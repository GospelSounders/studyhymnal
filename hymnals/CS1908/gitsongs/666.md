# 1

The Lord is my Shepherd, no want shall I know,

I feed in green pastures, safe folded I rest,

He leadeth my soul where the still waters flow,

Restores me when wand'ring, redeems when oppress'd,

Restores me when wand'ring, redeems when oppress'd.



# 2

Thro the valley and shadow of death tho' I stray,

Since Thou art my Guardian, no evil I fear;

Thy rod shall deend me, Thy staff be my stay;

No harm can befall, with my Comforter near,

No harm can befall, with my Comforter near.



# 3

In the midst of affliction my table is spread;

With blessings unmeasured my cup runneth o'er;

With perfume and oil Thou anointest my head;

Oh, what shall I ask of Thy providence more?

Oh, what shall I ask of Thy providence more?



# 4

Let goodness and mercy, my bountiful God,

Still follow my steps till I meet Thee above,

I seek by the path which my forefather trod,

Thro' the land of their sojourn, Thy kingdom of love,

Thro' the land of their sojourn, Thy kingdom of love.
