# 1

Come, sinners, to the Living One,

He's just the same Jesus

As when He raised the widow's son,

The very same Jesus.



Chorus:

The very same Jesus,

The wonder working Jesus:

O praise His name!

He's just the same,

The very same Jesus.



# 2

Come, feast upon the "living bread,"

He's just the same Jesus

As when the multitudes He fed,

The very same Jesus.  [Chorus]



# 3

Come, tell Him all your griefs and fears,

He's just the same Jesus

As when He shed those loving tears,

The very same Jesus.  [Chorus]



# 4

Come unto Him for clearer light,

He's just the same Jesus

As when He gave the blind their sight,

The very same Jesus.  [Chorus]



# 5

Calm 'midst the waves of trouble be,

He's just the same Jesus

As when He hush'd the raging sea,

The very same Jesus.  [Chorus]



# 6

Some day our raptured eyes shall see

He's just the same Jesus;

O blessed day for you and me!

The very same Jesus.  [Chorus]
