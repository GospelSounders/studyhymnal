# 1

O Christian, awake! ’tis the Master’s command;

With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand,

To meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go,

Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.



# Refrain

Stand like the brave, stand like the brave,

Stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.



# 2

The cause of thy Master with vigor defend;

Be watchful, be zealous, and fight to the end;

Wherever He leads thee, go, valiantly go,

Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.



# 3

Press on, never doubting, thy Captain is near,

With grace to supply, and with comfort to cheer;

His love, like a stream in the desert will flow;

Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
