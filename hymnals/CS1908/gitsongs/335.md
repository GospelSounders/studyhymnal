# 1

O worship the King, all glorious above,

And gratefully sing his wonderful love;

Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,

Pavilion'd in splendor, and girded with praise.



# 2

O tell of his might and sing of his grace,

Whose robe is the light; whose canopy, space;

His chariots of wrath the deep thunder clouds form,

And dark is his path on the wings of the storm.



# 3

Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?

It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;

It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,

And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.



# 4

Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,

In Thee do we trust, nor find thee to fail;

Thy mercies, how tender!  how firm to the end!

Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.
