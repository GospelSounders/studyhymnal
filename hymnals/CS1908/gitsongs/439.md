# 1

Come, let us join our cheerful songs

With angels round the throne;

Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,

But all their joys are one;

But all their joys are one.



# 2

Worthy the Lamb who died, they cry,

To be exalted thus;

Worthy the Lamb, our hearts reply,

For he was slain for us;

For he was slain for us.



# 3

Jesus is worthy to receive

Honor and pow'r divine;

And blessings more than we can give,

Be, Lord, forever thine;

Be, Lord, forever thine.
