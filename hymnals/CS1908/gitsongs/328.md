# 1

Worthy, worthy, is the Lamb,

Worthy, worthy is the Lamb;

Worthy, worthy is the Lamb

That was slain.



Chorus:

Glory, hallelujah!  

Praise him, hallelujah!

Glory, hallelujah

To the Lamb!



# 2

Saviour, let thy kingdom come!

Now the pow'r of sin consume;

Bring thy blest millennium,

Holy Lamb.  [Chorus]



# 3

Thus may we each moment feel,

Love him, serve him, praise him still,

Till we all on Zion's hill

See the Lamb.  [Chorus]
