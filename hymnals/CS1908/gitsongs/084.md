# 1

The mistakes of my life are many,

The sins of my heart are more,

And I scarce can see for weeping,

But I knock at the open door.



Chorus:

I know I am weak and sinful,

It comes to me more and more;

But since the dear Saviour has bid me come in,

I'll enter the open door.



# 2

I am lowest of those who love Him,

I am weakest of those who pray;

But I come as He has bidden,

And He will not say me nay.  [Chorus]



# 3

My mistakes His free grace will cover,

My sins He will wash away,

And the feet that shrink and falter,

Shall walk thro' the gates of day.  [Chorus]
