# 1

In some way or other the Lord will provide,

It may not be my way,

It may not be thy way,

And yet in his own way, "the Lord will provide."



# 2

At some time or other the Lord will provide;

It may not be my time,

It may not be thy time,

And yet in his own time, "The Lord will provide."



# 3

Despond then no longer, the Lord will provide;

And this be the token

No word he hath spoken

Was ever yet broken, "the Lord will provide."



# 4

March on, then, right boldly; the sea shall divide;

The path shall be glorious;

With shoutings victorious

We'll join in the chorus, "the Lord will provide."
