# 1

With rev'rence let the saints appear,

And bow before the Lord;

His high commands with rev'rence hear,

And tremble at his word,

And tremble at his word.



# 2

Sing, all ye ransomed of the Lord,

Your great Deliv'rer sing;

Ye pilgrims now for Zion bound,

Be joyful in your King,

Be joyful in your King.



# 3

O Jesus, Lord of earth and heav'n,

Our life and joy, to thee

Be honor, thanks, and blessing giv'n

Thro' all eternity,

Thro' all eternity.
