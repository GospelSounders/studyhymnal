# 1

Take the world, but give me Jesus,

All its joys are but a name;

But His love abideth ever,

Thro' eternal years the same.



Chorus:

Oh, the height and depth of mercy!

Oh, the length and breadth of love!

Oh, the fullness of redemption,

Pledge of endless life above!



# 2

Take the world, but give me Jesus,

Sweetest comfort of my soul;

With my Saviour watching o'er me,

I can sing, tho' billows roll.  [Chorus]



# 3

Take the world, but give me Jesus,

Let me view His constant smile;

Then thro'out my pilgrim journey

Light will cheer me all the while.  [Chorus]



# 4

Take the world, but give me Jesus,

In His cross my trust shall be;

Till, with clearer, brighter vision, 

Face to face my Lord I see.  [Chorus]
