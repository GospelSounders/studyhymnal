# 1

Long upon the mountains, weary.

Have the scattered flock been torn;

Dark the desert paths, and dreary;

Grievous trials have they borne.

Now the gath'ring call is sounding,

Solemn in its warning voice;

Union, faith, and love, abounding,

Bid the little flock rejoice.



# 2

Now the light of truth they're seeking.

In its onward track pursue;

All the ten commandments keeping,

They are holy, just, and true.

On the words of life they're feeding,

Precious to their taste, so sweet;

All their Master's precepts heeding,

Bowing humbly at his feet.



# 3

Soon He comes, with clouds descending;

All his saints, entombed, arise;

The redeemed, in anthems blending,

Shout their vict'ry thro' the skies.

O, we long for thine appearing!

Come, O Saviour, quickly come!

Blessed hope!  our spirits cheering,

Take thy ransomed children home.
