# 1

There is sunlight on the hilltop,

There is sunlight on the sea,

And the golden beams are sleeping,

On the soft and verdant lea;

But a richer light is filling

All the chambers of my heart;

For thou dwellest there my Saviour,

And 'tis sunlight where thou art.



Refrain:

O the sunlight!  beautiful sunlight!

O the sunlight in the heart!

Jesus' smile can banish sadness;

It is sunlight in the heart.



# 2

In the dust I leave my sadness,

As the garb of other days,

For thou robest me with gladness,

And thou fillest me with praise;

And to that bright home of glory

Which thy love hath won for me,

In my heart and mind ascending,

My glad spirit follows thee.  [Refrain]



# 3

Loving Saviour, thou hast bought me,

And my life, my all, is thine;

Let the lamp thy love hath lighted

To thy praise and glory shine;

And to that bright home of glory

Which thy love hath won for me,

In my heart and mind ascending,

My glad spirit follows thee. [Refrain]
