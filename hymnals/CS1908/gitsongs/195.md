# 1

Would we be joyful in the Lord?

Then count the riches o'er,

Revealed to faith within His Word,

And note the boundless store.



Chorus:

There is pardon, peace and pow'r,

And purity, and Paradise;

With all of these in Christ for me,

Let joyful songs of praise to Him arise.



# 2

For ev'ry sin, by grace divine

A pardon free bestowed;

And with the pardon peace is mine,

The peace in Jesus' blood.  [Chorus]



# 3

Of grace to break the pow'r of sin,

He gives a full supply;

The Holy Ghost, the heart within,

From sin doth purify.  [Chorus]



# 4

The pow'r to win a soul to God,

The Spirit, too, imparts;

And He, the gift of Christ, our Lord,

Dwells now in all our hearts.  [Chorus]



# 5

These blessings we by faith receive,

By simple childlike trust;

In Christ 'tis God's delight to give;

He promised, and He must.  [Chorus]
