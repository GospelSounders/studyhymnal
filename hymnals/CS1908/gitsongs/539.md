# 1

Just a ray of sunshine

Breaking thro' the gloom,

Makes the earth rejoice again,

And the flow'rs to bloom:

Makes the earth rejoice again

And makes the flow'rs to bloom.



# 2

Just a little kindness,

Bright and sunny smile,

Makes the sad heart sing again,

All its cares beguile,

Makes the sad heart sing again

And all its cares beguile.



# 3

Words and smiles so kindly

Like the sunshine fall,

Let your presence ever be

Blessings unto all;

Let your presence ever be

Rich blessings unto all.
