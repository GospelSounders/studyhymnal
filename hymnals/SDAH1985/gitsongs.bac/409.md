# 1

Jesus invites His saints

To meet around His board,

And sup in memory of the death

And sufferings of their Lord.



# 2

We take the bread and wine

As emblems of Thy death;

Lord, raise our souls above the sign,

To feast on Thee by faith.



# 2

Faith eats the bread of life,

And drinks the living wine;

It looks beyond this scene of strife

Unites us to the Vine.



# 4

Soon shall the night be gone,

Our Lord will come again;

The marriage supper of the Lamb

Will usher in His reign.
