# 1

I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory,

A dear, loving Savior, though earth friends be few;

And now He is watching in tenderness o’er me,

But oh that my Savior were your Savior, too.



# Refrain

For you I am praying, For you I am Praying,

For you am I praying, I’m praying for you.



# 2

I have a Father; to me He has given

A hope for eternity, blessed and true;

And soon He will call to meet Him in heaven,

But oh that He’d let me bring you with me, too!



# 3

I have a robe; ’tis resplendent in whiteness,

Awaiting in glory my wondering view;

Oh, when I receive it, all shining in brightness,

Dear friend, could I see you receiving one, too!



# 4

When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,

That my loving Savior is your Savior, too;

Then pray that your Savior will bring them to glory,

And prayer will be answered-’twas answered for you!
