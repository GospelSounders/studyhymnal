1.

There'll be no grief in heav'n;

For life is one glad day,

And tears are of those former things

Which all have passed away.



Refrain:

There'll be no sorrow there,

There'll be no sorrow there;

In heav'n above, where all is love,

There'll be no sorrow there.



2.

There'll be no sin in heav'n;

Behold that blessed throng,

All holy in their spotless robes,

All holy in their song.  [Refrain]



3.

There'll be no death in heav'n;

For they who gain that shore

Have won their immortality,

And they can die no more. [Refrain]
