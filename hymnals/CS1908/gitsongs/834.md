1.

Lord, speak to me, that I may speak

In living echoes of Thy tone;

As Thou hast sought, so let me seek

Thy erring children lost and lone.



2.

O lead me, Lord, that I may lead

The wand'ring and the wav'ring feet;

O feed me, Lord, that I may feed

Thy hung'ring ones with manna sweet.



3.

O strengthen me, that while I stand

Firm on the Rock, and strong in Thee,

I may stretch out a loving hand

To wrestlers with the troubled sea.
