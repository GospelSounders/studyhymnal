# 1

Thou didst leave Thy throne

And Thy kingly crown

When Thou camest to earth for me;

But in Bethlehem’s home

Was there found no room

For Thy holy nativity.



# Refrain

O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,

There is room in my heart for Thee.



# 2

Heaven’s arches rang

When the angels sang

Proclaiming Thy royal degree;

But of lowly birth

Didst Thou come to earth,

And in greatest humility.



# 3

The foxes found rest,

And the birds their nest

In the shade of the forest tree;

But Thy couch was the sod,

O Thou Son of God,

In the deserts of Galilee.



# 4

Thou camest, O Lord,

With the living word

That should set Thy people free;

But with mocking scorn,

And with crown of thorn,

They bore Thee to Calvary.



# 5

When the heavens shall ring,

And the angels sing,

At Thy coming to victory,

Let Thy voice call me home,

Saying, “Yet there is room,

There is room at My side for thee.”



# Refrain

My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,

When Thou comest and callest for me.
