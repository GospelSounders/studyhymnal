# 1

I love to tell the story

of unseen things above,

of Jesus and his glory,

of Jesus and his love.

I love to tell the story,

because I know ’tis true;

it satisfies my longings

as nothing else can do.



# Refrain

I love to tell the story,

’twill be my theme in glory,

to tell the old, old story

of Jesus and his love.



# 2

I love to tell the story;

more wonderful it seems

than all the golden fancies

of all our golden dreams.

I love to tell the story,

it did so much for me;

and that is just the reason

I tell it now to thee.



# 3

I love to tell the story;

’tis pleasant to repeat

what seems, each time I tell it,

more wonderfully sweet.

I love to tell the story,

for some have never heard

the message of salvation

from God’s own holy Word.



# 4

I love to tell the story,

for those who know it best

seem hungering and thirsting

to hear it like the rest.

And when, in scenes of glory,

I sing the new, new song,

’twill be the old, old story

that I have loved so long.
