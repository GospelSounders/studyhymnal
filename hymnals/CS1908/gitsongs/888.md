1.

Beautiful city, haven of peace,

Beautiful home where weeping shall cease;

When shall thy gates be opened to me?

When shall I rest forever in thee?



Refrain:

Beautiful city, haven of peace,

Home of the soul, where weeping shall cease;

Beautiful city, waiting for me,

When shall I rest forever in thee?



2.

Beautiful city, haven of joy,

Heavenly praise our tongues shall employ;

Glad are thy songs that never grow old,

Bright are thy walls of jasper and gold.  [Refrain]



3.

Beautiful city, haven of rest,

Beautiful mansions, home of the blest;

O how I long thy glories to see!

Beautiful city, waiting for me.  [Refrain]
