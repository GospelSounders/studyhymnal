# 1

Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;

Living with Jesus, a new life divine;

Looking to Jesus 'till glory doth shine,

Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.



Chorus:

Moment by moment I'm kept in His love;

Moment by moment I've life from above;

Looking to Jesus 'till glory doth shine;

Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.



# 2

Never a trial that He is not there,

Never a burden that He doth not bear,

Never a sorrow that He doth not share,

Moment by moment I'm under His care.  [Chorus]



# 3

Never a heartache, and never a groan,

Never a teardrop and never a moan;

Never a danger but there on the throne,

Moment by moment He thinks of His own.  [Chorus]



# 4

Never a weakness that He doth not feel,

Never a sickness that He cannot heal;

Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,

Jesus, my Saviour, abides with me still.  [Chorus]
