# 1

Not in the hour of death,

Not when the pulse is low,

Not with the failing breath,

Not when you fear to go;



Refrain:

Come to Him now, come.

Come to Him now.

Jesus can save,

O come to him now;

Jesus will save,

O come to him now.



# 2

Not when the frost of time 

Has changed the gold to gray;

Come in the golden prime

Of manhood's summer day.  [Refrain]



# 3

Not when the noon of care

Has robbed the flow'rs of dew;

Come in the morning fair,

Of life's glad springtime new.  [Refrain]
