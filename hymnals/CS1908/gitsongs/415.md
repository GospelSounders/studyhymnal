# 1

Baptized into our Saviour's death,

Our souls to sin must die;

With Christ our Lord we live anew,

With Christ ascend on high,

With Christ ascend on high.



# 2

There by his Father's side he sits,

Enthroned divinely fair;

Yet owns himself our Brother still,

And our forerunner there,

And our forerunner there.



# 3

Rise from these earthly trifles, rise

On wings of faith and love;

Above, our choicest treasure lies,

And be our hearts above,

And be our hearts above.
