# 1

Praise, O praise our God and King!

Hymns of adoration sing;

For his mercies still endure,

Ever faithful, ever sure.



# 2

Praise him that he made the sun,

Day by day his course to run,

And the silver moon by night,

Shining with her gentle light.



# 3

Praise him for our harvest store;

He hath fill'd the garner floor;

And for richer Food than this,

Pledge of everlasting bliss.
