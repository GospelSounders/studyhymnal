# Refrain

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim,

Till all the world adore His sacred Name.



# 1

Come, Christians, follow where our Captain trod,

Our King victorious, Christ, the Son of God.



# 2

Led on their way by this triumphant sign,

The hosts of God in conquering ranks combine.



# 3

All newborn soldiers of the Crucified

Bear on their brows the seal of Him Who died.



# 4

O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,

As Thou hast promised, draw us all to Thee.



# 5

So shall our song of triumph ever be:

Praise to the Crucified for victory!
