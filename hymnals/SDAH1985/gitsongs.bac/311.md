# 1

Earthly pleasures vainly call me;

I would be like Jesus;

Nothing worldly shall enthrall me;

I would be like Jesus.



# Refrain

Be like Jesus, this my song,

In the home and in the throng;

Be like Jesus, all day long!

I would be like Jesus.



# 2

He has broken every fetter,

I would be like Jesus;

That my soul may serve Him better,

I would be like Jesus.



# 3

All the way from earth to glory,

I would be like Jesus;

Telling o’er and o’er the story,

I would be like Jesus.



# 4

That in Heaven He may meet me,

I would be like Jesus;

That His words “Well done” may greet me,

I would be like Jesus.
