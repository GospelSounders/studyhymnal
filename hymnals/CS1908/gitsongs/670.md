# 1

Christ for the world we sing;

The world to Christ we bring,

With loving zeal; 

The poor, and them that mourn,

The faint and overborne,

Sin sick and sorrow worn,

Whom Christ doth heal.



# 2

Christ for the world we sing;

The world to Christ we bring,

With fervent pray'r;

The wayward and the lost,

By restless passions toss'd,

Redeemed at countless cost,

From dark despair.



# 3

Christ for the world we sing;

The world to Christ we bring,

With joyful song;

The newborn souls, whose days,

Reclaimed from error's ways,

Inspired with hope and praise,

To Christ belong.
