# 1

Lord, I hear of show'rs of blessing

Thou art scatt'ring full and free;

Show'rs the thirsty soul refreshing;

Let some drops now fall on me;



Refrain:

Even me, even me,

Let some drops now fall on me.



# 2

Pass me not, O gracious Father!

Sinful though my heart may be;

Thou might'st leave me, but the rather

Let thy mercy rest on me.  [Refrain]



# 3

Have I long in sin been sleeping?

Long been slighting, grieving thee?

Has the world my heart been keeping?

O forgive and rescue me!  [Refrain]



# 4

Pass me not, O holy Spirit!

Thou canst make the blind to see;

Testify of Jesus' merit,

Speak the word of peace to me.  [Refrain]
