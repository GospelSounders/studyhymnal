# 1

O Lord, our heavenly King,

Thy name is all divine;

Thy glories round the earth are spread,

And o'er the heavens they shine.



# 2

Lord, what is worthless man,

That thou shouldst love him so?

Next to thine angels he is placed,

And lord of all below.



# 3

Now rich thy bounties are,

And wondrous are thy ways!

In us O let thy power frame

A monument of praise!
