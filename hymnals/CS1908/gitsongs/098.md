# 1

Where is my wand'ring boy to-night

The boy of my tenderest care,

The boy that was once my joy and light,

The child of my love and prayer?



Chorus:

O where is my boy to-night?

O where is my boy to-night?

My heart o'erflows, for I love him, he knows;

O where is my boy to-night?



# 2

Once he was pure as morning dew,

As he knelt at his mother's knee;

No face was so bright, no heart more true,

And none was so sweet as he.  [Chorus]



# 3

O could I see you now, my boy,

As fair as is olden time,

When prattle and smile made home a joy,

And life was a merry chime;  [Chorus]



# 4

Go for my wand'ring boy to-night;

Go, search for him where you will;

But bring him to me with all his blight,

And tell him I love him still.  [Chorus]
