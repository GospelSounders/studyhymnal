# 1

In the blood from the cross,

I have been washed from sin;

But to be free from dross,

Still I would enter in.



# Refrain

Deeper yet, deeper yet,

Into the crimson flood;

Deeper yet, deeper yet,

Under the precious blood.



# 2

Day by day, hour by hour,

Blessings are sent to me;

But for more of His power,

Ever my prayer shall be.



# 3

Near to Christ I would live,

Following Him each day;

What I ask He will give;

So then with faith I pray.



# 4

Now I have peace, sweet peace,

While in this world of sin;

But to pray I’ll not cease

Till I am pure within.
