# 1

Thy broken body, gracious Lord,

Is shadowed by this broken bread;

The wine which in this cup is poured,

Points to the blood which Thou hast shed.



# 2

And while we meet together thus,

We show that we are one in Thee;

Thy precious blood was shed for us,

Thy death, O Lord, hast set us free!



# 3

We have one hope that Thou wilt come,

Thee in the air we wait to see;

When Thou wilt give Thy saints a home,

And we shall ever reign with Thee.
