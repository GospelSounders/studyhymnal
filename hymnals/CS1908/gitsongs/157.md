157 â€“ That Dreadful Day


1
The day of wrath, that dreadful day,
When heav'n and earth shall pass away!
What pow'r shall be the sinner's stay?
How shall he meet that dreadful day?

2
When shriv'ling like a parched scroll,
The flaming heav'ns together roll,
And louder yet, and yet more dread,
Resounds the trump that wakes the dead,

3
On that great day, that wrathful day,
When man to Judgment wakes from clay,
Be thou, O Christ, thy people's stay,
Tho' heav'n and earth shall pass away.
