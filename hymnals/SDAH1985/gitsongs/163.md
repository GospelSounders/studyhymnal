# 1

Alas! and did my Savior bleed,

and did my Sovereign die?

Would he devote that sacred head

for sinners such as I?



# Refrain

At the cross, at the cross,

where I first saw the light,

and the burden of my heart rolled away;

it was there by faith I received my sight,

and now I am happy all the day!



# 2

Was it for crimes that I have done,

he groaned upon the tree?

Amazing pity! Grace unknown!

And love beyond degree!



# 3

But drops of grief can ne’er repay

the debt of love I owe:

Here, Lord, I give myself away;

’tis all that I can do!
