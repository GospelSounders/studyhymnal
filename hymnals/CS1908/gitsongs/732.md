# 1

Meek and lowly, pure and holy.

Chief among the blessed three.

Turning sadness into gladness,

Heav'n born art thou, charity!

Pity dwelleth in thy bosom.

Kindness reigneth o'er thy heart;

Gentle thoughts alone can sway thee

Judgment hath in thee no part.



# 2

Hoping ever, failing never.

Though deceived, believing still;

Long abiding, all confiding

To thy heav'nly Father's will;

Never weary of well-doing.

Never fearful of the end;

Claiming all mankind as brothers,

Thou dost all alike befriend.
