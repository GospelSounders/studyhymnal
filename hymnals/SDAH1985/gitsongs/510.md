# 1

If you but trust in God to guide you

And place your confidence in Him,

You’ll find Him always there beside you,

To give you hope and strength within.

For those who trust God’s changeless love

Build on the rock that will not move.



# 2

What gain is there in futile weeping,

In helpless anger and distress?

If you are in His care and keeping,

In sorrow will He love you less?

For He who took for you a cross

Will bring you safe through every loss.



# 3

In patient trust await His leisure

In cheerful hope, with heart content

To take whate’er your Father’s pleasure

And all discerning love have sent;

Doubt not your inmost wants are known

To Him who chose you for His own.



# 4

Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving,

Offer your service faithfully,

And trust His word; though undeserving,

You’ll find His promise true to be.

God never will forsake in need

The soul that trusts in Him indeed.
