# 1

The God of Abraham praise,

Who reigns enthroned above;

Ancient of everlasting days,

And God of love;

Jehovah! Great I AM!

By earth and heaven confessed;

I bow and bless the sacred name,

Forever blest.



# 2

The God of Abraham praise,

At whose supreme command

From earth I rise, and seek the joys

At His right hand;

I all on earth forsake,

Its wisdom, fame and power;

And Him my only portion make,

My shield and tower.



# 3

The whole triumphant host

Give thanks to God on high;

“Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!”

They ever cry;

Hail, Abraham’s God and mine!

I join the heavenly lays;

All might and majesty are Thine,

And endless praise.
