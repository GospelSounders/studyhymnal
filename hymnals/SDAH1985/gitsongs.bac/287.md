# 1

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,

calling for you and for me;

see, on the portals he’s waiting and watching,

watching for you and for me.



# Refrain

Come home, come home;

ye who are weary come home;

earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,

calling, O sinner, come home!



# 2

Why should we tary when Jesus is pleading,

pleading for you and for me?

Why should we linger and heed not his mercies,

mercies for you and for me?



# 3

Think of the wonderful love he has promised,

promised for you and for me!

Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon,

pardon for you and for me.
