# 1

We have heard a joyful sound,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

Spread the gladness all around,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

Bear the news to every land,

Climb the steeps and cross the waves,

Onward, ’tis our Lord’s command,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves.



# 2

Waft it on the rolling tide,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

Tell to sinners, far and wide,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

Sing, ye islands of the sea.

Echo back, ye ocean caves,

Earth shall keep her jubilee,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves.



# 3

Sing above the battle’s strife,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

By His death and endless life,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

Sing it softly through the gloom,

When the heart for mercy craves,

Sing in triumph o’er the tomb,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves.



# 4

Give the winds a mighty voice,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

Let the nations now rejoice,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

Shout salvation full and free,

Highest hills and deepest caves,

This our song of victory,

Jesus saves, Jesus saves.
