806 â€“ Thy Will Be Done


1.
Jesus, while our hearts are bleeding,
O'er the spoils that death has won,
We would at this solemn meeting,
Calmly say, "Thy will be done."

2.
Tho' cast down, we're not forsaken;
Tho' afflicted, not alone;
Thou didst give, and Thou hast taken;
Blessed Lord, Thy will be done.

3.
By Thy hands the boon was given,
Thou hast taken but Thine own;
Lord of earth, and God of heaven,
Evermore Thy will be done.
