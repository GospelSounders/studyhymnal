# 1

Just to trust in the Lord, just to lean on His word,

Just to feel I am His ev'ry day;

Just to walk by His side with His Spirit to guide,

Just to follow where He leads the way.



Chorus:

Just to say what He wants me to say,

And be still when He whispers to me;;

Just to go where He wants me to go,

Just to be what He wants me to be.



# 2

When my way darkest seems, when are blighted my dreams,

Just to feel that the Lord knoweth best;

Just to yield to His will, just to trust, and be still,

Just to lean on His bosom and rest.  [Chorus]



# 3

Then my heart will be light, then my path will be bright,

If I've Jesus for my dearest friend;

Counting all loss but gain, such a friend to obtain,

True and faithful He'll be to the end.  [Chorus]
