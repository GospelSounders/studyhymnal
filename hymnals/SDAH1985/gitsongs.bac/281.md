# 1

I gave my life for thee,

My precious blood I shed,

That thou might’st ransom be,

And quickened from the dead;

I gave, I gave My life for thee,

What hast thou given for Me?

I gave, I gave My life for thee,

What hast thou given for Me?



# 2

My Fathers house of light,

My glory circled throne,

I left for earthly night,

For wanderings sad and lone;

I left, I left it all for thee,

Hast thou left aught for Me?

I left, I left it all for thee,

Hast thou left aught for Me?



# 3

I suffered much for thee,

more than thy tongue can tell,

Of bitterest agony,

To rescue thee from hell;

I’ve borne, I’ve borne it all for thee,

What hast thou borne for Me?

I’ve borne, I’ve borne it all for thee,

What hast thou borne for Me?
