047 â€“ Not in the Hour of Death


1
Not in the hour of death,
Not when the pulse is low,
Not with the failing breath,
Not when you fear to go;

Refrain:
Come to Him now, come.
Come to Him now.
Jesus can save,
O come to him now;
Jesus will save,
O come to him now.

2
Not when the frost of time 
Has changed the gold to gray;
Come in the golden prime
Of manhood's summer day.  [Refrain]

3
Not when the noon of care
Has robbed the flow'rs of dew;
Come in the morning fair,
Of life's glad springtime new.  [Refrain]
