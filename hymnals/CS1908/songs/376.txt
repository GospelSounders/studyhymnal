376 â€“ Power to Obey


1
Grant thy blessing, now, O Lord,
While we look into thy word:
To our hearts thy truth reveal;
Fill us with a holy zeal;
As we learn thy righteous way,
Give us power to obey.

2
Sanctify us, Lord, we pray,
By the lessons of this day:
May our souls by thee be fed,
And to living fountains led;
In a world of care and sin,
Keep us ever pure within.
