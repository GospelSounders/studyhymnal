# 1

Lord of all good, our gifts we bring You now;

Use them Your holy purpose to fulfill.

Tokens of love and pledges they shall be

That our whole life is offered to Your will.



# 2

We give our minds to understand Your ways;

Hands, voices, eyes to serve Your great design;

Hearts with the flame of your own love ablaze:

Thus for Your glory all our pow’rs combine.



# 3

Father, whose bounty all creation shows;

Christ, by whose willing sacrifice we live;

Spirit, from whom all life in fullness flows:

To You with grateful hearts ourselves we give.
