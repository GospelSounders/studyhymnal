# 1

Return, O wanderer, return,

And seek thy Father's face;

Those new desires which in thee burn,

Were kindled by his grace.



# 2

Return, O wanderer, return;

Thy Saviour bids thee live;

Come to his cross, and, grateful, learn

How freely he'll forgive.



# 3

Return, O wanderer, return,

And wipe the falling tear;

Thy Father calls no longer mourn;

'Tis love invites thee near.
