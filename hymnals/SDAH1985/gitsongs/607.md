# 1

God of grace and God of glory,

On Thy people pour Thy power;

Now fulfill Thy church’s story,

Bring her bud to glorious flower.

Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,

For the facing of this hour.



# 2

Lo, the hosts of evil round us

Scorn Thy Christ, assail His ways;

From the fears that long have bound us

Free our hearts to faith and praise.

Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,

For the facing of this hour.



# 3

Cure Thy children’s warring madness,

Bend our pride to Thy control;

Shame our wanton selfish gladness

Rich in goods and poor in soul.

Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,

Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal.



# 4

Set our feet on lofty places,

Gird our lives that they may be

Armored with all Christ-like graces

In the fight to set all free.

Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,

That we fail not man nor Thee.
