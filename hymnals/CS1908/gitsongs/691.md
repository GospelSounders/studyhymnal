# 1

I've reach'd the land of corn and wine,

And all its riches fully mine;

Here shines undim'd one blissful day,

For all my night has pass'd away.



Chorus:

O, Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land,

As on thy highest mount I stand,

I look away across the sea,

Where mansions are prepar'd for me,

And view the shining glory shore,

My heav'n, my home forevermore.



# 2

My Saviour comes and walks with me,

And sweet communion here have we;

He gently leads me by the hand,

For this is heaven's border land.  [Chorus]



# 3

A sweet perfume upon the breeze

Is borne from ever vernal trees

And flow'rs that never fading grow

Where streams of life forever flow  [Chorus]



# 4

The zephyrs seem to float to me

Sweet sounds of heaven's melody,

As angels with the white-rob'd throng

Join in the sweet redemption song.  [Chorus]
