# 1

The wonders of redeeming love

Our highest thoughts exceed;

The Son of God comes from above

For sinful man to bleed.



# 2

He gives Himself, His life, His all,

A sinless sacrifice.

For man He drains the cup of gall,

For man the victim dies.



# 3

And now before His Father’s face

His precious blood He pleads;

For those who seek the throne of grace

His love still intercedes.



# 4

He knows the frailties of our frame,

For He has borne our grief;

Our great High Priest once felt the same,

And He can send relief.



# 5

His love will not be satisfied,

Till He in glory sees

The faithful ones for whom He died

From sin forever free.
