1.

Always with us, always with us,

Words of cheer and words of love;

Thus the risen Saviour whispers,

From his dwelling place above.

With us when we toil in sadness,

Sowing much and reaping none;

Telling us that in the future, 

Golden harvest shall be won.



2.

With us when the storm is sweeping

O'er our pathway dark and drear;

Waking hope within our bosoms,

Stilling ev'ry anxious fear.

With us in the lonely valley,

When we cross the chilling stream;

Lighting up the gloomy shadows

With salvation's radiant beam.
