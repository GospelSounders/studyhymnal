# 1

Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,

God of glory, Lord of love;

Hearts unfold like flow’rs before Thee,

Hail Thee as the sun above.

Melt the clouds of sin and sadness,

Drive the dark of doubt away;

Giver of immortal gladness,

Fill us with the light of day!



# 2

All Thy works with joy surround Thee,

Earth and heav’n reflect Thy rays,

Stars and angels sing around Thee,

Center of unbroken praise;

Field and forest, vale and mountain,

Bloss’ming meadow, flashing sea,

Chanting bird and flowing fountain

Call us to rejoice in Thee.



# 3

Thou art giving and forgiving,

Ever blessing, ever blest,

Wellspring of the joy of living,

Oceandepth of happy rest!

Thou the father, Christ our Brother –

All who live in love are Thine:

Teach us how to love each other,

Lift us to the joy divine.
