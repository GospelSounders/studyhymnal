# 1

Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear

My voice ascending high;

To Thee will I direct my prayer,

To Thee lift up mine eye-



# 2

Up to the hills where Christ is gone

To plead for all His saints,

Presenting at His Father’s throne

Our songs and our complaints.



# 3

O may Thy Spirit guide my feet

In ways of righteousness;

Make every path of duty straight

And plain before my face.

4 The men that love and fear Thy name

Shall see their hopes fulfilled;

The mighty God will compass them

With favor as a shield.
