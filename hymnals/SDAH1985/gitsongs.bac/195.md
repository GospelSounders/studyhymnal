# 1

“There shall be showers of blessing;”

This is the promise of love;

There shall be seasons refreshing,

Sent from the Savior above.



# Refrain

Showers of blessing,

Showers of blessing we need;

Mercy drops round us are falling,

But for the showers we plead.



# 2

“There shall be showers of blessing;”

Precious reviving again;

Over the hills and the valleys,

Sound of abundance of rain.



# 3

“There shall be showers of blessing;”

Send them upon us, O Lord;

Grant to us now a refreshing;

Come, and now honor Thy word.



# 4

“There shall be showers of blessing;”

O that today they might fall,

Now as to God were confessing,

Now as on Jesus we call!
