# 1

Christ is coming! let creation

Bid her groans and travail cease;

Let the glorious proclamation

Hope restore and faith increase;

Christ is coming! Christ is coming!

Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!

(Prince of Peace!)

Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!



# 2

Earth can now but tell the story

Of Thy bitter cross and pain;

She shall yet behold Thy glory

When Thou comest back to reign;

Christ is coming! Christ is coming!

Let each heart repeat the strain.

(repeat the strain)

Let each heart repeat the strain.



# 3

With that “blessed hope” before us,

Let no harp remain unstrung;

Let the mighty advent chorus

Onward roll from tongue to tongue:

Christ is coming! Christ is coming!

Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!

(quickly come!)

Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
