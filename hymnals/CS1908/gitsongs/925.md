1.

We've no abiding city here;

Sad truth, were this to be our home;

But let this thought our spirits cheer,

We seek a city yet to come,

We seek a city yet to come.



2.

We've no abiding city here,

We seek a city out of sight;

Zion its name, the Lord is there,

It shines with ever lasting light,

It shines with ever lasting light.



3.

O sweet abode of peace and love,

Where pilgrims freed from toil, are blest!

Had I the pinions of a dove,

I'd fly to thee, and be at rest,

I'd fly to thee, and be at rest.



4.

But hush, my soul!  nor dare repine;

The time my God appoints is best;

While here, to do his will be mine,

And his to fix my time of rest,

And his to fix my time of rest.
