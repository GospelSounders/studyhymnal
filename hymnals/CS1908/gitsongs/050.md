# 1

Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus,

When the cares of life upon you roll,

He will heal the wounded heart,

He will strength and grace impart;

Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.



Chorus:

The best friend to have is Jesus,

The best friend to have is Jesus,

He will help you when you fall,

He will hear you when you call;

Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.



# 2

What a friend I have found in Jesus!

Peace and comfort to my soul He brings;

Leaning on His mighty arm,

I will fear no ill nor harm;

Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.  [Chorus]



# 3

Tho' I pass thro' the night of sorrow,

And the chilly waves of Jordan roll,

Never need I shrink nor fear,

For my Saviour is so near;

Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.  [Chorus]



# 4

When at last to our home we gather,

With the faithful who have gone before,

We will sing upon the shore,

Praising Him forevermore;

Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.  [Chorus]
