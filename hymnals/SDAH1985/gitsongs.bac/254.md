# 1

The great Physician now is near,

The sympathizing Jesus;

He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,

Oh! hear the voice of Jesus.



# Refrain

Sweetest note in seraph song,

Sweetest name on mortal tongue;

Sweetest carol ever sung,

Jesus, blessed Jesus.



# 2

Your many sins are all forgiven,

Oh! hear the voice of Jesus;

Go on your way in peace to heaven,

And wear a crown with Jesus.



# 3

All glory to the dying Lamb!

I now believe in Jesus;

I love the blessed Savior’s name,

I love the name of Jesus.



# 4

His name dispels my guilt and fear,

No other name but Jesus;

Oh! how my soul delights to hear

The charming name of Jesus.
