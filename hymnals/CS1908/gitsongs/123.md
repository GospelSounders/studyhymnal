# 1

Arise, my soul, arise,

Shake off thy guilty fears;

The bleeding Sacrifice

In my behalf appears;

Before the throne my Surety stands,

Before the throne my Surety stands;

My name is written on his hands.



# 2

He ever lives above,

For me to intercede;

His all redeeming love,

His precious blood to plead;

His blood was shed for all our race,

His blood was shed for all our race,

And sprinkles now the throne of grace.



# 3

Five bleeding wounds he bears,

Received on Calvary;

They pour effectual pray'rs,

They strongly speak for me:

"Forgive him, O, forgive!"  they cry, 

"Forgive him, O, forgive!"  they cry,

"Nor let the contrite sinner die!"



# 4

The Father hears him pray,

His dear, anointed One;

He would not turn away

The presence of his Son:

His Spirit answers to the blood,

His Spirit answers to the blood,

And tells me I am born of God.
