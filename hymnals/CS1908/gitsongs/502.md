# 1

Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,

He'll help you along, help you along;

If you will trust His love unfailing,

He'll fill your heart with song.



Chorus:

Lean on His arms, trusting in His love;

Lean on His arms, all His mercies prove;

Lean on His arms, looking home above,

Just lean on the Saviour's arms!



# 2

Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,

He'll brighten the way, brighten the way;

Just follow gladly where He leadeth,

His gentle voice obey.  [Chorus]



# 3

Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,

O bring ev'ry care, bring ev'ry care!

The burden that has seemed so heavy,

Take it to the Lord in pray'r.  [Chorus]



# 4

Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,

Then leave all to Him, leave all to Him;

His heart is full of love and mercy,

His eyes are never dim.  [Chorus]
