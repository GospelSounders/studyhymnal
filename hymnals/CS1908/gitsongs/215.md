# 1

The name of Jesus is so sweet,

I know its music to repeat;

It makes my joys full and complete,

The precious name of Jesus.



Chorus:

"Jesus," oh, how sweet the name!

"Jesus," ev'ry day the same;

"Jesus," let all saints proclaim

Its worthy praise forever.



# 2

I love the name of Him whose heart

Knows all my griefs and bears a part;

Who bids all anxious fears depart

I love the name of Jesus.  [Chorus]



# 3

That name I fondly love to hear,

It never fails my heart to cheer,

Its music dries the falling tears;

Exalt the name of Jesus.  [Chorus]



# 4

No word of man can ever tell

How sweet the name I love so well;

Oh, let its praise ever swell,

Oh, praise the name of Jesus.  [Chorus]
