# 1

In the cross of Christ I glory,

towering o’er the wrecks of time;

all the light of sacred story

gathers round its head sublime.



# 2

When the woes of life o’ertake me,

hopes deceive, and fears annoy,

never shall the cross forsake me.

Lo! it glows with peace and joy.



# 3

When the sun of bliss is beaming

light and love upon my way,

from the cross the radiance streaming

adds more luster to the day.



# 4

Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,

by the cross are sanctified;

peace is there that knows no measure,

joys that through all time abide.
