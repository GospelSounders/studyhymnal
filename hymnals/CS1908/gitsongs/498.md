# 1

Give me the Bible, star of gladness gleaming,

To cheer the wand'rer lone and tempest tossed;

No storm can hide that peaceful radiance beaming,

Since Jesus came to seek and save the lost.



Chorus:

Give me the Bible, Holy message shining,

Thy light shall guide me in the narrow way.

Precept and promise, law and love combining,

Till night shall vanish in eternal day.



# 2

Give me the Bible when my heart is broken,

When sin and grief have filled my soul with fear;

Give me the precious words by Jesus spoken,

Hold up faith's lamp to show my Saviour near.  [Chorus]



# 3

Give me the Bible, all my steps enlighten,

Teach me the danger of these realms below;

That lamp of safety, o'er the gloom shall brighten,

That light alone the path of peace can show.  [Chorus]



# 4

Give me the Bible, lamp of life immortal,

Hold up that splendor by the open grave;

Show me the  light from heaven's shining portal,

Show me the glory gilding Jordan's wave.  [Chorus]
