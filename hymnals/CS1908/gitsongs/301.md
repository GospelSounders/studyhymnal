# 1

I know I love thee better, Lord,

Than any earthly joy;

For thou hast given me the peace

Which nothing can destroy.



Chorus:

The half has never yet been told,

Of love so full and free;

The half has never yet been told,

The blood it cleanseth me.



# 2

I know that thou art nearer still

Than any earthly throng;

And sweeter is the tho't of thee

Than any lovely song.  [Chorus]



# 3

Thou hast put gladness in my heart;

Then may I well be glad;

Without the secret of thy love 

I could not but be sad.  [Chorus]



# 4

O Saviour, precious Saviour, mine!

What will thy presence be,

If such a life of joy can crown

Our walk on earth with thee?  [Chorus]
