# 1

Out on an ocean all boundless we ride,

We're homeward bound, homeward bound;

Tossed on the waves of a rough, restless tide,

We're homeward bound, etc.

Far from the safe, quiet harbor we've rode,

Seeking our Father's celestial abode,

Promise of which on us each is bestowed,

We're homeward bound, homeward etc.



# 2

Wildly the storm sweeps us on as it roars,

We're homeward bound, etc.

Look!  yonder lie the bright heavenly shores,

We're homeward bound, etc.

Steady, O pilot!  stand firm at the wheel;

Steady, we soon shall outweather the gale;

O, how we fly 'neath the loud-creaking sail!

We're homeward bound, etc.



# 3

Into the harbor of heaven now we glide,

We're home at last, home at last;

Softly we drift on its bright silver tide,

We're home at last, home at last.

Glory to God!  all our dangers are o'er,

We stand secure on the glorified shore;

Glory to God!  we shall shout ever more;

We're home at last, home at last.
