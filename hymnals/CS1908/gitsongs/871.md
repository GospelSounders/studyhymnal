1.

Who are these whose songs are sounding

O'er the golden harps above?

Hark!  they tell of grace abounding

And Jehovah's sov'reign love.



Chorus:

These are they who wash'd their robes

and made them white in the blood of the Lamb

These are they who wash'd their robes 

and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.



2.

Who are these that keep their station

Round the great eternal throne?

They from earthly tribulation

To their heav'nly rest are gone.  [Chorus]



3.

See their robes of dazzling whiteness,

Without blemish, spot or stain;

See their crowns that grow in brightness

Purchas'd by the Lamb once slain.  [Chorus]



4.

'Tis the Lamb of God who leads them,

And they serve Him night and day,

By the heav'nly fount He leads them

He hath wiped their tears away.  [Chorus]



5.

Sweet the theme:  'tis still "salvation 

Unto Christ the Holy One."

And their sighs of tribulation

Change to songs around the throne.  [Chorus]
