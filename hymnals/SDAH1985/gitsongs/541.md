# 1

Lord, speak to me, that I may speak

in living echoes of thy tone;

as thou has sought, so let me seek

thine erring children lost and lone.



# 2

O lead me, Lord, that I may lead

the wandering and the wavering feet;

O feed me, Lord, that I may feed

thy hungering ones with manna sweet.



# 3

O strengthen me, that while I stand

firm on the rock, and strong in thee,

I may stretch out a loving land

to wrestlers with the troubled sea.
