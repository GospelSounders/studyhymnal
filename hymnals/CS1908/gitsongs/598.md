# 1

Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"

Kept, by the pow'r of God;

Kept, from the world unspotted,

Treading where Jesus trod.



Refrain:

Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"

Lord at Thy feet I fall;

I would be "nothing, nothing, nothing;"

Thou shalt be "all in all."



# 2

Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"

Serving as He shall choose;

"Kept" for the Master's pleasure;

"Kept" for the Master's use.  [Refrain]



# 3

Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"

Kept from the world apart;

Lowly in mind and spirit,

Gentle and pure in heart.  [Refrain]



# 4

Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"

Oh, to be all His own!

Kept, to be His forever,

Kept to be His alone!  [Refrain]
