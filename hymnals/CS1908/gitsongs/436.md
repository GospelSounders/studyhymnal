# 1

I've found the Pearl of greatest price!

My heart doth sing for joy;

And sing I must, for Christ is mine!

He shall my song employ,

He shall my song employ.



# 2

Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King;

My prophet full of light,

My great High Priest before the throne,

My King of heav'nly might,

My King of heav'nly might.



# 3

Christ is my peace; he died for me,

For me he shed his blood;

And as my wondrous Sacrifice,

Offered himself to God,

Offered himself to God.



# 4

Christ Jesus is my all in all,

My comfort and my love;

My life below, and he shall be

My joy and crown above,

My joy and crown above.
