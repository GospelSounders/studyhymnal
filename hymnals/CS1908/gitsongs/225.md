# 1

Tho' my sins were once like crimson red,

To the healing stream my feet were led;

In the precious blood my Saviour shed

He washed me white as snow.



Chorus:

O my joyful song henceforth shall be,

" 'Tis the blood of Jesus cleanseth me,

Cleanseth, cleanseth, 

O, yes, it cleanseth me."



# 2

At the door of faith I entered in,

And to him confessed my guilt and sin;

With his own dear hand he washed me clean,

He washed me white as snow.  [Chorus]



# 3

Tho' my heart was all I had to give,

Yet he smiled and bade me look and live;

What a calm, sweet peace did I receive!

He washed me white as snow.  [Chorus]



# 4

I will sing his pow'r from death to save,

I will sing his triumph o'er the grave,

I will sing beyond death's chilling wave,

"He washed me white as snow."  [Chorus]
