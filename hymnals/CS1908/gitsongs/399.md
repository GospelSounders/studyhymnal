# 1

O, happy day!  that fixed my choice

On thee, my Saviour and my God;

Well may this glowing heart rejoice,

And tell its raptures all abroad.

Happy day, happy day,

When Jesus washed my sins away!

He taught me how to watch and pray,

And live rejoicing ev'ry day;

Happy day, happy day,

When Jesus washed my sins away!



# 2

'Tis done, the great transaction's done;

I am my Lord's, and he is mine;

He drew me, and I followed on,

Rejoiced to own the call divine.



# 3

Now rest, my long-divided heart,

Fixed on this blissful center, rest;

Nor ever from thy Lord depart,

With him of ev'ry good possessed.
