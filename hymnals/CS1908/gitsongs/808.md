1.

In grief and fear, to thee, O Lord,

We now for succor fly;

Thine awful judgments are abroad,

O shield us, lest we die.



2.

O look with pity on the scene 

Of sadness and of dread;

And let thine angel stand between

The living and the dead.



3.

With contrite hearts to thee, our King,

We turn who oft have strayed;

Accept the sacrifice we bring,

And let the plague be stayed.
