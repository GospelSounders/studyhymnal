1.

O blessed hour, when ev'ning comes,

And calls us to our place of pray'r!

With joyful heart our feet we turn

To meet Thee and Thy children there.



2.

With one accord we gather here,

Our wants make known, our sins confess;

Dear Saviour, wilt Thou now appear

And bless, as only Thou canst bless.



3.

Our faith increase, our fears remove,

Make strong the weak, the helpless raise;

May ev'ry heart now feel Thy love,

And ev'ry tongue speak forth Thy praise.



4.

No want have we Thou canst not fill,

No need but Thou canst fully meet;

May we obey Thy gracious will,

And find our lives in Thee complete.
