# 1

Angry words!  oh, let them never

From the tongue unbridled slip;

May the heart's best impulse ever

Check them e'er they soil the lip.



Chorus:

"Love one another," Thus saith the Saviour,

Children, obey the Father's blest command:

"Love one another," Thus saith the Saviour,

Children, obey his blest command.



# 2

Love is much too pure and holy,

Friendship is too sacred far,

For a moment's reckless folly

Thus to desolate and mar.  [Chorus]



# 3

Angry words are lightly spoken;

Bitt'rest tho'ts are rashly stirred

Brightest links of life are broken,

By a single angry word.  [Chorus]
