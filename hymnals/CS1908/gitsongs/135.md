# 1

O that the Lord would guide my ways

To keep his statutes still!

O that my God would grant me grace

To know and do his will!



# 2

O send thy Spirit down to write

Thy law upon my heart,

Nor let my tongue indulge deceit,

Nor act the liar's part.



# 3

From vanity turn off my eyes,

Let no corrupt design

Nor covetous desires arise

Within this soul of mine.



# 4

Order my footsteps by thy word,

And make my heart sincere;

Let sin have no dominion, Lord,

But keep my conscience clear.
