# 1

Lord, thy glory fills the heaven;

Earth is with its fulness stored;

Unto thee be glory given,

Holy, holy, holy Lord!

Heav'n is still with anthems ringing;

Earth takes up the angel's cry,

Holy, holy, holy, singing,

Lord of hosts, thou Lord most high.



# 2

Ever thus in God's high praises,

Brethren, let our tongues unite;

While our tho't his greatness raises,

And our love his gifts excite:

With his seraph train before him,

With his holy church below,

Thus unite we to adore him,

Bid we thus our anthem flow.



# 3

Lord, thy glory fills the heaven,

Earth is with its fulness stored;

Unto thee be glory given,

Holy, holy, holy Lord!

Thus thy glorious name confessing,

We adopt the angel's cry,

Holy, holy, holy, blessing 

Thee, the Lord our God most high!
