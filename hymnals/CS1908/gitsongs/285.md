# 1

For all the saints who from their labors rest,

Who Thee by faith before the world confessed,

Thy Name, O Jesus, be for ever blest,

Alleluia!  Alleluia!



# 2

Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress, and their Might;

Thou, Lord, their Captain, in the well-fought fight;

Thou, in the darkness their true guiding Light. 

Alleluia!  Alleluia!



# 3

O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,

Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,

And win with them the victor's crown of gold.

Alleluia!  Alleluia!



# 4

And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,

Steals on the ears the distant triumph song,

And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong. 

Alleluia!  Alleluia!
