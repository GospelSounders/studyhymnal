# 1

God, who stretched the spangled heavens

Infinite in time and place,

Flung the suns in burning radiance

Through the silent fields of space;

We, Your children in Your likeness,

Share inventive powers with You;

Great Creator, still creating,

Show us what we yet may do.



# 2

We have ventured worlds undreamed of

Since the childhood of our race;

Knowing the ecstasy of winging

Through untraveled realms of space,

Probed the secrets of the atom,

Yielding unimagined power,

Facing us with life’s destruction

Or our most triumphant hour.



# 3

As each far horizon beckons,

May it challenge us anew:

Children of creative purpose,

Serving others, honoring You.

May our dreams prove rich with promise;

Each endeavor well begun;

Great Creator, give us guidance

Till our goals and Yours are one.
