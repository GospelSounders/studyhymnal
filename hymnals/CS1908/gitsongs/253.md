# 1

Little stars that twinkle in the heaven's blue,

I have often wondered if you ever knew,

How there 'rose one like you, leading wise old men

From the East, thro' Judah, down to Bethlehem.



# 2

Did you see the costly presents they had bro't?

Did you see the stable they in wonder sought?

Did you see the worship tenderly they paid

To that stranger baby in the manger laid?



# 3

Did you hear the mothers pleading thro' their tears

For the babies that Herod slew the coming years?

Did you see how Joseph, warn'd of God in dreams,

Hurried into Egypt guided by your beams?



# 4

Did you watch the Saviour all those years of strife?

Did you know, for sinners, how he gave his life?

Little stars that twinkle in the heaven's blue,

All you saw of Jesus how I wish I knew.
