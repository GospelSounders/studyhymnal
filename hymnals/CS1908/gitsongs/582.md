# 1

Into the tent where a gypsy boy lay,

Dying alone at the close of the day,

News of Salvation we carried; said he,

"Nobody ever has told it to me!"



Chorus:

Tell it again!  tell it again!

Salvation's story repeat o'er and o'er,

Till none can say of the children of men,

"Nobody ever has told me before."



# 2

"Did he so love me, a poor little boy?

Send unto me the good tidings of joy?

Need I not perish?  my hand will he hold?

Nobody ever the story has told!"  [Chorus]



# 3

Bending, we caught the last words of his breath,

Just as he entered the valley of death,

"God sent his Son!"  "whosoever," said he;

"Then I am sure that he sent him for me!"  [Chorus]



# 4

Smiling, he said, as his last sigh he spent,

"I am so glad that for me he was sent!"

Whispered, while low sank the sun in the west,

"Lord, I believe;" "tell it now to the rest!"  [Chorus]
