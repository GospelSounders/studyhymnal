# 1

In joyful high and holy lays

My soul her grateful voice would raise;

But who can sing the worthy praise

Of the wonderful love of Jesus?



Refrain:

Wonderful love!  wonderful love!

Wonderful love of Jesus!

Wonderful love!  wonderful love!

Wonderful love of Jesus!



# 2

A joy by day, a peace by night,

In storms a calm, in darkness light,

In pain a balm, in weakness might,

Is the wonderful love of Jesus.  [Refrain]



# 3

My hope for pardon when I call,

My trust for lifting when I fall;

In life, in death, my all in all,

Is the wonderful love of Jesus.  [Refrain]
