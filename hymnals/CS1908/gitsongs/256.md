# 1

Our sweetest songs of gladness,

On this delightful day,

We bring to praise the Saviour,

Who is the Life, the Way.



Chorus:

We sing, we sing

The praises of our King,

We sing, we sing

The glory of our King.



# 2

He lov'd the little children,

When he was here below,

And tho' he's up in heaven,

He loves us yet we know.  [Chorus]



# 3

We love to sing his praises

And hear the stories told,

Of him when he was dwelling

In Galilee of old.  [Chorus]



# 4

O Saviour, blessed Saviour,

We kneel, before thy throne,

And ask that thou wilt help us

To live for thee alone.  [Chorus]
