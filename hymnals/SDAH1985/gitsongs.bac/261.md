# 1

The Spirit of the Lord revealed

His will to saints of old;

Their heart and mind lips unsealed

His glory to unfold.

Amid the gloom of ancient night

They hailed the dawning Word,

And in the coming of the light

Proclaimed the coming Lord.



# 2

The prophets passed; at length there came

To sojourn and abide,

The Word incarnate, to whose name

The prophets testified;

And He, the twilight overpast,

Himself, the Light of light,

As man with man, revealed at last

The Father to our sight.



# 3

Eternal Spirit, who dost speak

To mind and conscience still,

That we in this our day, may seek

To do our Father’s will,

To us the word of life impart,

Of Christ, the living way;

Give us the quiet, humble heart

To hear and to obey.
