# 1

In the highways and hedges go seek for the lost,

Gather them in to the fold,

Was the earnest command that our Saviour divine

Taught his disciples of old.



Chorus:

Urge them to come, show them the way;

Tenderly, lovingly, bring them today;

Urge them to come, why should they roam?

Bring them along to our dear Saviour's home.



# 2

If the Shepherd we love, we will care for the sheep;

Precious are they in his sight;

They are out in the desert, they wander alone;

Lead them from darkness to light.  [Chorus]



# 3

To the weary and thirsty the Saviour has said,

"Come, heavy laden, to me,

I will give you to drink of the water of life;"

Tell them the fountain is free.  [Chorus]



# 4

There's welcome for all in the kingdom of grace,

All who repent and believe;

And the souls that have stray'd and returned to the fold,

Jesus will gladly receive.  [Chorus]
