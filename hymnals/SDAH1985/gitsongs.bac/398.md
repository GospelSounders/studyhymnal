# 1

Bread of the world in mercy broken,

Wine of the soul in mercy shed,

By whom the words of life are spoken,

And in whose death our sins are dead;



# 2

Look on the heart by sorrow broken,

Look on the tears by sinners shed;

And be Thy feast to us the token

That by Thy grace our souls are fed. Amen.
