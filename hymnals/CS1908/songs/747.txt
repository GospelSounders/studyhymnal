747 – Children of the King


1.
Children of the heav'nly King
As we journey, sweetly sing;
Sing your Saviour's worthy praise,
Glorious in his works and ways.

2.
We are trav'ling home to God,
In the way the fathers trod;
And when Christ our Lord shall come,
We shall all be gathered home.

3.
Shout, ye little flock, and blest,
You near Jesus' throne shall rest;
There your seats are now prepared,
There your kingdom and reward.

4.
Fear not, brethren, joyful stand
On the borders of your land;
Jesus Christ, your Father's Son,
Bids you undismayed go on.
