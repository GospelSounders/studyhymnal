# 1

Breathe on me, breath of God,

Fill me with life anew,

That I may love what Thou dost love,

And do what Thou wouldst do.



# 2

Breathe on me, breath of God,

Until my heart is pure,

Until with Thee I will one will,

To do and to endure.



# 3

Breathe on me, breath of God,

Till I am wholly Thine,

Until this earthly part of me

Glows with Thy fire divine.



# 4

Breathe on me, breath of God,

So shall I constant be,

And live with Thee the perfect life

Of Thine eternity.
