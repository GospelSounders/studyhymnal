# 1

Open my eyes, that I may see

Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;

Place in my hands the wonderful key

That shall unclasp and set me free.

Silently now I wait for Thee,

Ready, my God, Thy will to see;

Open my eyes,

illumine me, Spirit Divine!



# 2

Open my ears that I may hear

Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;

and while the wavenotes fall on my ear,

Everything false will disappear.

Silently now I wait for Thee,

Ready, my God, Thy will to see;

Open my ears, illumine me, Spirit Divine!



# 3

Open my mouth, and let me bear

Gladly the warm truth everywhere;

Open my heart, and let me prepare

Love with Thy children thus to share.

Silently now I wait for Thee,

Ready, my God, Thy will to see;

Open my heart, illumine me, Spirit Divine!
