1.

Mid scenes of confusion and creature complaints,

How sweet to my soul is communion of saints;

To find at the banquet of mercy there's room,

And feel in the presence of Jesus at home.

Home, home, sweet, 

Prepare me, dear Saviour, for heaven my home.



# 2

Sweet bonds that unite all the children of peace,

And thrice precious Jesus, whose love can not cease!

Tho' oft from thy presence in sadness I roam,

By faith I behold thee in glory at home.

Home, home, sweet,

Prepare me, dear Saviour, for heaven my home.



# 3

While where in this valley of conflict I stay,

O give me submission, and strength as my day;

In all my afflictions to thee would I come,

Rejoicing in hope of my glorious home.

Home, home, sweet,

Prepare me, dear Saviour, for heaven my home.
