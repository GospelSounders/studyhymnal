1.

"Land ahead!"  its fruits are waving

O'er the hills of fadeless green,

And the living waters laving

Shores where heav'nly forms are seen.



Chorus:

Rock and storms I'll fear no more,

When on that eternal shore;

I am safe within the vail!



2.

Onward bark!  the cape I'm rounding;

See the blessed wave their hands!

Hear the harps of God resounding

From the bright immortal band!  [Chorus]



3.

Now we're safe from all temptation,

All the storms of life are past

Praise the Rock of our salvation,

We are safe at home at last!  [Chorus]
