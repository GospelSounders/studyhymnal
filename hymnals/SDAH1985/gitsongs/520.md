# 1

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,

A wonderful Savior to me,

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,

Where rivers of pleasure I see.



# Refrain

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock

That shadows a dry, thirsty land;

he hideth my life in the depths of His love,

And covers me there with His hand,

And covers me there with His hand.



# 2

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,

He taketh my burden away,

He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,

He giveth me strength as my day.



# 3

With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,

And filled with His fullness divine,

I sing in my rapture, Oh, Glory to God

For such a Redeemer as mine.



# 4

When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise

To meet Him in clouds of the sky,

His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,

I’ll shout with the millions on high.
