543 â€“ Lift!  Brother, Lift!


1
When the cross seems hard to carry,
Lift!  brother, lift!
O'er the burden never tarry,
Lift!  brother, lift!

Chorus:
Lift the cross and clasp it tighter,
Lift!  brother, lift!
Lifting makes the burden lighter,
Lift!  brother, lift!

2
Duty's call is self-denying,
Lift!  brother, lift!
Half the battle lies in trying,
Lift!  brother, lift!  [Chorus]

3
When the evil seems the strongest,
Lift!  brother, lift!
Lift the hardest, lift the longest,
Lift!  brother, lift!  [Chorus]
