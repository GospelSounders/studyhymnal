# 1

Sound the alarm!  let the watchman cry,

"Up!  for the day of the Lord is nigh;

Who will escape from the wrath to come?

Who have a place in the soul's bright home?"



Chorus:

Sound the alarm, watchman,

Sound the alarm!

For the Lord will come with a conqu'ring arm;

And the hosts of sin, as their ranks advance,

Shall wither and fall at His glance.



# 2

Sound the alarm!  let the cry go forth,

Swift as the wind, o'er the realms of earth;

Flee to the Rock where the soul may hide!

Flee to the Rock!  in its cleft abide.  [Chorus]



# 3

Sound the alarm on the mountain's brow!

Plead with the lost by the wayside now;

Warn them to come and the truth embrace;

Urge them to come and be saved by grace.  [Chorus]



# 4

Sound the alarm in the youthful ear,

Sound it aloud that the old may hear;

Blow ye the trump while the day beams last!

Blow ye the trump till the light is past!  [Chorus]
