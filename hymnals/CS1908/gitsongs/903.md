1.

Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning!

Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain!

Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning:

Zion, in triumph, begins her mild reign.



2.

Lo, in the desert, rich flowers are springing;

Streams ever copious are gliding along;

Loud, from the mountaintops, echoes are ringing;

Wastes rise in verdure, and mingle in song.



3.

See, the dead risen from land and from ocean;

Praise to Jehovah, ascending on high;

Fall'n are the engines of war and commotion;

Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.
