# 1

The Lord in Zion reigneth, let all the world rejoice,

And come before His throne of grace with tuneful heart and voice;

The Lord in Zion reigneth, and there His praise shall ring,

To Him shall princes bend the knee and kings their glory bring.



# 2

The Lord in Zion reigneth, and who so great as He?

The depths of earth are in His hands; He rules the mighty sea.

O crown His Name with honor, and let His standard wave,

Till distant isles beyond the deep shall own His power to save.



# 3

The Lord in Zion reigneth, these hours to Him belong;

O enter now His temple gates, and fill His courts with song;

Beneath His royal banner let every creature fall,

Exalt the King of heaven and earth, and crown Him Lord of all.
