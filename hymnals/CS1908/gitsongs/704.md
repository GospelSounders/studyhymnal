# 1

Could you wait, could you wait if a brother were lost

In the dark, stormy night, and a flood to be cross'd?

If you knew how to guide him from danger and death,

Would you sit idly singing sweet carols of faith?

O, the faith born above

Is the faith full of love!

Could you wait?  Could you wait?  Could you wait?



# 2

Could you wait, could you wait if a sister should cry, 

"I am wall'd in by fire!  I'm not ready to die!"

If her cottage or palace were circled with flame,

And you heard her voice calling you, calling by name,

Would you linger to read

Of some beautiful deed?

Could you wait?  Could you wait?  Could you wait?



# 3

In the flood, in the flood and the tempest-torn night,

There are brothers now wand'ring who long for the right;

There are sisters as gentle as ever were known,

Whom the fires of perdition surround as their own:

They are yielding their blood

To the flame and the flood,

Can you wait?  Can you wait?  Can you wait?
