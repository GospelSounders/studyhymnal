# 1

Thou art the Way, to thee alone,

From sin and death we flee;

And he who would the Father seek,

Must seek him, Lord, by thee.



# 2

Thou art the Truth; thy word alone,

True wisdom can impart;

Thou only canst inform the mind,

And purify the heart.



# 3

Thou art the Life; the rending tomb

Proclaims thy conq'ring arm;

And those who put their trust in thee,

Nor death nor hell shall harm.



# 4

Thou art the Way, the Truth, the life;

Grant us that way to know,

That truth to keep, that life to win,

Whose joys eternal flow.
