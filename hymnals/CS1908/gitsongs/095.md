# 1

Come, ev'ry soul by sin oppressed,

There's mercy with the Lord,

And he will surely give you rest,

By trusting in his word.



Chorus:

Only trust him, only trust him,

Only trust him now;

He will save you, he will save you,

He will save you now.



# 2

For Jesus shed his precious blood

Rich blessings to bestow;

Plunge now into the crimson flood

That washes white as snow.  [Chorus]



# 3

Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way,

That Leads you into rest;

Believe in him without delay,

And you are fully blest.  [Chorus]



# 4

Come, then, and join this holy band,

And on to glory go,

To dwell in that celestial land,

Where joys immortal flow.  [Chorus]
