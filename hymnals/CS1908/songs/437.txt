437 – Prayer


1
Pray'r is the soul's sincere desire,
Unuttered or expressed;
The motion of a hidden fire
That trembles in the breast.

2
Pray'r is the burden of a sigh,
The falling of a tear,
The upward glancing of an eye,
When none but God is near.

3
Pray'r is the simplest form of speech
That infant lips can try;
Pray'r the sublimest strains that reach
The Majesty on high.
