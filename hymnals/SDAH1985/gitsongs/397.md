# 1

An upper room did our Lord prepare

For those loved until the end:

And His disciples still gather there,

To celebrate their risen Friend.



# 2

And after supper He washed their feet,

For service, too, is sacrament.

In Him our joy shall be made complete

Sent out to serve, as He was sent.



# 3

A lasting gift Jesus gave His own:

To share His bread, His loving cup.

Whatever burdens may bow us down,

He by His cross shall lift us up.



# 4

No end there is! we depart in peace.

He loves beyond our uttermost:

In every room in our Father’s house,

He will be there, as Lord and host.
