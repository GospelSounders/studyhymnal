# 1

He will mention them no more forever,

My sins are all taken away;

For his royal promise changes never,

My sins are all taken away.



Chorus:

They are all taken away,

They are all taken away;

He will mention them no more forever;

Praise the Lord!  sing it all day.

They are all taken away,

They are all taken away;

I am resting in the great Peace Giver, 

My sins are all taken away.



# 2

Since I came by faith to Calv'ry's mountain,

My sins are all taken away;

Thro' the cleansing pow'r of that blest Fountain,

My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]



# 3

At the bottom of the sea they're lying,

My sins are all taken away;

Now the pow'rs of sin and self denying,

My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]



# 4

Once the "carnal mind" was all my pleasure,

My sins are all taken away;

Now the word of God is my chief treasure,

My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]



# 5

Doubt can never stay where Faith is singing,

"My sins are all taken away;"

"Praise the Lord" within my heart is ringing,

My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]
