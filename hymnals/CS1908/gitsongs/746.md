1.

I ask not, Lord, for less to bear

Here in the narrow way,

But that I may thy blessing share

In all I do or say,

In all I do or say.



2.

With thee to lead, I will not fear

In scenes with danger rife,

While still thy cheering voice I hear,

"I am the Way, the Life,

I am the Way, the Life."



3.

Then help me to improve with care,

These precious moments giv'n;

For they a faithful record bear,

Of good or ill, to Heav'n,

Of good or ill, to Heav'n.
