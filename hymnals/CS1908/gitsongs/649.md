# 1

There is never a day so dreary,

But God can make it bright;

And to the soul that trusts him,

He giveth pure delight;

There is never a path so hidden,

But God will show the way,

If we will seek his guidance,

And patiently will pray.



# 2

There is never a cross so heavy,

But Jesus' hands are there,

Outstretched in sweet compassion,

Our burden still to bear;

There is never a life so darkened,

So hopeless, so unblest,

But may be fill'd with gladness,

In Jesus' peace may rest.



# 3

There is never a heart so broken,

But Jesus Christ can heal;

The heart once pierced on Calv'ry

Doth for his people feel;

He will never fulfill his promise,

His word can never fail;

God is our help in trouble,

Our strength when foes assail.
