# 1

When in our music God is glorified,

And adoration leaves no room for pride,

It is as though the whole creation cried:

Alleluia!



# 2

How oft, in making music, we have found

A new dimension in the world of sound,

As worship moved us to a more profound

Alleluia!



# 3

And did not Jesus sing a psalm that night

When utmost evil strove against the light?

Then let us sing for whom He won the fight:

Alleluia!



# 4

Let every instrument be used for praise;

Let all rejoice who have a voice to raise;

And may God give us faith to sing always:

Alleluia!
