206 â€“ Tarry By the Living Waters


1
We'll tarry by the living waters,
The fountain pure and free;
There Jesus waits to give us welcome,
A welcome sweet 'twill be.

Chorus:
We'll tarry by the living waters,
Tarry by the living waters;
Tarry by the living waters,
Tarry by the Fount of Life.

2
When weary with the toilsome journey,
'Tis sweet to rest awhile
Where crystal waters gently murmur,
And sunny fountains smile.  [Chorus]

3
Then come to Christ, the living water,
Thy strength will he restore;
Come, taste the joy of his salvation,
And drink to thirst no more.  [Chorus]
