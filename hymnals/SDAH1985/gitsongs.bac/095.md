# 1

Spring has now unwrapped the flowers,

Day is fast reviving,

Life in all her growing powers

Towards the light is striving:

Gone the iron touch of cold,

Winter time and frost time,

Seedlings, working through the mould,

Now make up for lost time.



# 2

Herb and plant that winter long,

Slumbered at their leisurek,

Now be stirring, green and strong,

Find in growth their pleasure:

All the world with beauty fills,

Gold the green enhacing;

Flowers make glee among the hills,

Set the meadows dancing.



# 3

Through each wonder of fair days

God Himself expresses;

Beauty follows all His ways,

As the world He blesses:

So, as He renews the earth,

Artist without rival,

In His grace of glad new birth

We must seek revival.
