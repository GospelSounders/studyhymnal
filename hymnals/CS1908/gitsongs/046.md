# 1

Jesus, the loving Shepherd,

Calleth thee now to come

Into the fold of safety,

Where there is rest and room;

Come in the strength of manhood,

Come in the morn of youth,

Enter the fold of safety,

Enter the way of truth.



Chorus: 

Lovingly, tenderly calling is he;

Wanderer, wanderer, come unto me,

Patiently standing there, waiting,

I See Jesus my Shepherd divine.



# 2

Jesus, the loving Shepherd,

Gave his dear life for thee,

Tenderly now he's calling,

Wanderer, come to me;

Haste, for without is danger,

Come, cries the Shepherd blest,

Enter the fold of safety,

Enter the place of rest.  [Chorus]



# 3

Lingering is but folly,

Wolves are abroad today,

Seeking the sheep now straying,

Seeking the lambs to stay;

Jesus, the loving Shepherd,

Calleth thee now to come

Into the fold of safety,

When there is rest and room.  [Chorus]
