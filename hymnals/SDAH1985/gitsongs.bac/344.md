# 1

I love thy kingdom, Lord,

the house of thine abode,

the church our blest Redeemer saved

with his own precious blood.



# 2

I love thy church, O God!

Her walls before thee stand

dear as the apple of thine eye,

and graven on thy hand.



# 3

Beyond my highest joy

I prize her heavenly ways,

her sweet communion, solemn vows,

her hymns of love and praise.



# 4

Sure as thy truth shall last,

to Zion shall be given

the brightest glories earth can yield,

and brighter bliss of heaven.
