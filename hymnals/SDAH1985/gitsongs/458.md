# 1

More love to thee, O Christ, more love to thee!

Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee.

This is my earnest plea: More love, O Christ, to thee;

more love to thee, more love to thee!



# 2

Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest;

now thee alone I seek, give what is best.

This all my prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;

more love to thee, more love to thee!



# 3

Let sorrow do its work, come grief and pain;

sweet are thy messengers, sweet their refrain,

when they can sing with me: More love, O Christ, to thee;

more love to thee, more love to thee!



# 4

Then shall my latest breath whisper thy praise;

this be the parting cry my heart shall raise;

this still its prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;

more love to thee, more love to thee!
