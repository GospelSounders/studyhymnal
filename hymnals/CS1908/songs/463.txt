463 – Submission Sweet


1
Thou who on the cross didst make
Sacrifice complete for me;
Thou who didst for my poor sake
Suffer on the cursed tree;
Thou didst teach submission sweet,
Washing the disciples' feet.

2
O my soul!  and shalt thou scorn
Thus to do as He hath done?
Thou a wretched, dying worm;
He the blessed, sinless One!
Gladly would I wish his feet,
Bowing in submission sweet.

3
Such a joy may not be mine,
Thus to prove my love for thee;
Such a privilege divine
Thou hast never given me;
But, in blest submission sweet,
Kneel I at thy servant's feet.
