# 1

We praise Thee with our minds,

O LordKept sharp think Thy thought;Come,

Holy Ghost with grace outpoured,

To teach what Christ hath taught.

In all our learning may we seekThat wisdom from above

Which comes to all: the brave,

the meekWho ask in faith and love.



# 2

We praise Thee thro’ our bodies,

Lord,Kept strong to do Thy will;

Thy Spirit’s temples, which afford

A means to praise Thee still.

We give ourselves, a sacrifice,

To live as unto Thee;

For Thou alone hast paid the priceTo bring salvation free.



# 3

We praise Thee in our hearts,

O king,Kept pure to know Thy ways;

And raise to Thee a hymn to sing

Eternally Thy praise.

Altho adoring hearts will bow

As age on ages roll;

We praise Thee in our beings now,

Mind, body, heart, and soul.
