# 1

Hear the temp'rance call,

Freemen one and all,

Hear your country's  earnest cry;

See your native land

Life her beck'ning hand;

Sons of freedom, come ye nigh.



Chorus:

Starve the monster from our shore,

Let his cruel reign be o'er;

Starve the monster from our shore,

Let his cruel reign be o'er.



# 2

Leave the shop and farm,

Leave your bright hearths warm;

Work and pray the lost to save;

Let your leaders be 

True and noble, free,

Fearless, temp'rate, good, and grave.  [Chorus]



# 3

Hail!  our Fatherland,

Here thy children stand,

All resolv'd, united, true;

In the temp'rance cause 

Ne'er to faint or pause!

This our purpose is, and vow.  [Chorus]
