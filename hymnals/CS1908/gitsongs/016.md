# 1

O heart bowed down with sorrow!

O eyes that long for sight!

There's gladness in believing;

In Jesus there is light.



Refrain:

"Come unto me, all ye that labor, 

and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;

for I am meek and lowly in heart:

and ye shall find rest unto your souls."



# 2

Earth's fleeting gain and pleasure

Can never satisfy;

'Tis love our joy doth measure,

For love can never die.  [Refrain]



# 3

Divinest consolation

Doth Christ the Healer give;

Art thou in condemnation?

Repent, believe and live.  [Refrain]



# 4

His peace is like a river,

His love is like a song;

His yoke's a burden never;

'Tis easy all day long.  [Refrain]
