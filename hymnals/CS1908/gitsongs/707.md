# 1

Zion stand with walls surrounded,

Zion, kept by pow'r divine:

All her foes shall be comfounded,

Though the world in arms combine:

Happy Zion,

What a favored lot is thine!



# 2

Ev'ry human tie may perish;

Friend to friend unfaithful prove;

Mothers cease their own to cherish;

Heav'n and earth at last remove:

But no changes

Can attend Jehovah's love.



# 3

In the furnace God may prove thee,

Thence to bring thee forth more bright;

But can never cease to love thee:

Thou art precious in his sight:

God is with thee,

God, thine everlasting light.
