# 1

At first I prayed for light:

Could I but see the way,

How gladly, swiftly would I walk

To everlasting day!



# 2

And next I prayed for strength:

That I might tread the road

With firm, unfaltering feet, and win

The heaven’s serene abode.



# 3

And then I asked for faith:

Could I but trust my God,

I’d live infolded in His peace,

Though foes were all abroad.



# 4

But now I pray for love:

Deep love to God and man;

A living love that will not fail,

However dark His plan.



# 5

And light and strength and faith

Are opening everywhere!

God waited patiently until

I prayed the larger prayer.
