# 1

Sing we of the modern city,

Scene alike of joy and stress;

Sing we of its nameless people

In their urban wilderness.

Into endless rows of houses

Life is set a millionfold,

Life expressed in human beings

Daily born and growing old.



# 2

In the city full of people,

World of speed and hectic days,

In the ever-changing setting

Of the latest trend and craze,

Christ is present, and among us;

In the crowd we see Him stand.

In the bustle of the city

Jesus Christ is every man.



# 3

God is not remote in heaven,

But on earth to share our shame,

Changing graph and mass and number

Into persons with a name.

Christ has shown, beyond statistics,

Human life with glory crowned,

By His timeless presence proving

People matter, people count!
