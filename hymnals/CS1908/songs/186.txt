186 â€“ I Do Believe


1
Father, I stretch my hands to thee;
No other help I know;
If thou withdraw thyself from me,
Ah, whither shall I go?

2
On thy dear Son I now believe,
O let me feel thy pow'r;
And all my varied wants relieve,
In this accepted hour.

3
Author of faith!  to thee I lift
My weary, longing eyes:
O let me now receive that gift;
My soul without it dies.
