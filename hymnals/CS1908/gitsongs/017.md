# 1

I've wandered far away from God,

Now I'm coming home;

The paths of sin too long I've trod;

Lord, I'm coming home.



Chorus:

Coming home, coming home

Nevermore to roam;

Open wide Thine arms of love;

Lord, I'm coming home.



# 2

I've wasted many precious years

Now I'm coming home;

I now repent with bitter tears;

Lord, I'm coming home.  [Chorus]



# 3

I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord,

Now I'm coming home;

I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy word;

Lord, I'm coming home.  [Chorus]



# 4

My only hope, my only plea,

Now I'm coming home;

That Jesus died, and died for me;

Lord, I'm coming home.  [Chorus]



# 5

I need His cleansing blood I know,

Now I'm coming home;

O wash me whiter than the snow;

Lord' I'm coming home.  [Chorus]
