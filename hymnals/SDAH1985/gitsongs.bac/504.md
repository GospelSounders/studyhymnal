# 1

Lord Jesus, think on me, And purge away my sin;

From earth-born passions set me free, And make me pure within.



# 2

Lord Jesus, think on me, With care and woe oppressed;

Let me Thy loving servant be, And taste Thy promised rest.



# 3

Lord Jesus, think on me, Nor let me go astray;

Through darkness and perplexity Point Thou the heavenly way.



# 4

Lord Jesus, think on me, That I may sing above

To Father, Spirit, and to Thee, The strains of praise and love.
