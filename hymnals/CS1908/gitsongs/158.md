# 1

I saw One hanging on the tree,

In agony and blood,

Who fixed His languid eyes on me,

As near His cross I stood.



# 2

O, never till my latest breath

Can I forget that look;

It seemed to charge me with His death,

Tho' not a word He spoke.



# 3

A second look He gave, which said, 

"I freely all forgive;

This blood is for thy ransom paid,

I die that thou may'st live."



# 4

Thus while His death my sin displays

In all its blackest hue,

Such is the mystery of grace,

It seals my pardon too.
