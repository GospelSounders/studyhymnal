1.

Our Father which art in heaven,

hallowed be Thy name;

Thy kingdom come; 

Thy will be done 

on earth as it is in heaven;



2.

Give us this day our daily bread;

And forgive us our debts,

as we forgive our debtors;



3.

And lead us not into temptation, 

but deliver us from evil;

For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, 

and the glory, forever.  Amen.
