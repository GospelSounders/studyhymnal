# 1

To the work!  to the work!  we are servants of God,

Let us follow the path that our Master has trod;

With the word of his counsel our strength to renew,

Let us do with our might what our hands find to do.



Chorus:

Toiling on, toiling on,

Toiling on, toiling on,

Let us hope, let us watch,

And labor till the Master comes.



# 2

To the work!  to the work!  let the hungry be fed;

To the Fountain of Life let the weary be led;

In the cross and its banner our glory shall be,

While we herald the tidings, "Salvation is free!"  [Chorus]



# 3

To the work!  to the work!  there is labor for all,

For the kingdom of darkness and error shall fall;

And the name of Jehovah exalted shall be

In the loud swelling chorus, "Salvation is free!"  [Chorus]



# 4

To the work!  to the work!  pressing on to the end,

For the harvest will come, and the reapers descend;

And the home of the ransom'd our dwelling will be,

And our chorus forever, "Salvation is free!"  [Chorus]
