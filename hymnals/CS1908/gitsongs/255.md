# 1

Sweetly sing, sweetly sing,

Praises to our heav'nly King;

Let us raise, let us raise

High our notes of praise;

Praise to Him whose name is Love,

Praise to Him who reigns above;

Raise your songs, raise your songs,

Now with thankful tongues.



# 2

Angels bright, angels bright,

Rob'd in garments pure and white,

Chant his praise, chant his praise

In melodious lays;

But from that bright, happy throng,

Ne'er can come this sweetest song,

"Pard'ning love, pard'ning love,

Brought us here above."



# 3

Far away, far away,

We in sin's dark valley lay,

Jesus came, Jesus came,

Blessed be his name;

He redeem'd us by his grace,

Then prepar'd in heav'n a place

To receive, to receive,

All who will believe.
