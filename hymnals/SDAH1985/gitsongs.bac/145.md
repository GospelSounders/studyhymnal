# 1

Songs of thankfulness and praise,

Jesus, Lord, to You we raise,

Manifested by the star

To the sages from afar;

Branch of royal David’s stem

In Your birth at Bethlehem;

Anthems be to You addressed,

God in man made manifest.



# 2

Manifest at Jordan’s stream,

Prophet, Priest, and King supreme;

And at Cana, wedding guest,

In Your Godhead manifest;

Manifest in power divine,

Changing water into wine;

Anthems be to You addressed,

God in man made manifest.



# 3

Manifest in making whole

Palsied limbs and fainting soul;

Manifest in valiant fight,

Quelling all the devil’s might;

Manifest in gracious will,

Ever bringing good from ill;

Anthems be to You addressed,

God in man made manifest.



# 4

Grant us grace to see You, Lord,

Mirrored in Your holy Word;

May we imitate Your way,

And be pure, as pure as we may,

That we like You may be

At Your great epiphany;

Let us praise You, ever blest,

God in man made manifest.
