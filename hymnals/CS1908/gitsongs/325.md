# 1

There lives a voice within me,

Guest angel of my heart,

Whose whisp'rings strive to win me

To act a noble part.

Up evermore it springeth

Like some sweet melody.

And evermore it singeth

This song of songs to me:



Chorus:

This world is full of beauty,

That points the soul above,

And if we did our duty,

It might be full of love.



# 2

The leaf tongues of the forest,

The flower lips of the sod,

The birds that hymn their raptures

Up to the throne of God;

The summer wind that bringeth

Joy over land and sea.

Have each a voice that singeth

This song of songs to me:  [Chorus]



# 3

O voice of God most tender,

O voice of God divine,

Still be my heart's defender

Till ev'ry tho't is Thine;

My soul in gladness bringeth

Its songs of praise to Thee,

While all around me singeth

This song of songs to me:  [Chorus]
