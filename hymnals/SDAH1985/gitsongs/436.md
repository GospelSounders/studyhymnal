# 1

The homeland! O the homeland!

The land of the free born!

There’s no night in the homeland,

But aye the fadeless morn;

I’m sighing for homeland,

My heart is aching here;

There is no pain in the homeland

To which I’m drawing near;

There is no pain in the homeland

To which I’m drawing near.



# 2

My Lord is in the homeland,

With angels bright and fair;

There’s no sin in the homeland,

And no temptation there;

The music of the homeland

Is ringing in my ears;

And when I think of the homeland

My eyes are filled with tears;

And when I think of the homeland

My ears are filled with tears.



# 3

The dwellers in the homeland

Are beckoning me to come,

Where neither death nor sorrow

Invades their holy name;

O dear, dear native country!

O rest and peace above!

Christ bring us all to the homeland

Of Thy redeeming love;

Christ bring us all to the homeland

Of Thy redeeming love
