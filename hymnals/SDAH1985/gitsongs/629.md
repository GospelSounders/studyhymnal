# 1

O happy band of pilgrims,

If onward ye will tread

With Jesus as your fellow,

To Jesus as your Head!



# 2

O happy if ye labor

As Jesus did for men;

O happy if ye hunger

As Jesus hungered then!



# 3

The trials that beset you,

The sorrows ye endure,

The manifold temptations

That death alone can cure,



# 4

What are they but His jewels

Of right celestial worth?

What are they but the ladder

Set up to heaven on earth?



# 5

O happy band of pilgrims,

Look upward to the skies,

Where such a light affliction

Shall win you such a prize!
