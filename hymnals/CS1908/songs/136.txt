136 – The Last Call of Mercy


1
The last call of mercy now lingers for thee;
O sinner, receive it; to Jesus now flee!
He often has called thee, but thou hast refused;
His offered salvation and love are abused.

2
O slight not the warning now offered at last,
Till summer is ended and harvest is past;
Till mercy, long slighted, has left thy heart's door,
And pardon, sweet pardon is offered no more.

3
While Jesus is calling, O turn not away;
For swiftly approaches the dread Judgment day:
The Spirit invites you, O why will you roam?
Come now to life's waters, ye thirsty ones, come.
