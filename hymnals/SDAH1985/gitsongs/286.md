# 1

Sing them over again to me,

wonderful words of life,

Let me more of their beauty see,

wonderful words of life;

Words of life and beauty

teach me faith and duty.



# Refrain

Beautiful words, wonderful words,

wonderful words of life,

Beautiful words, wonderful words,

wonderful words of life.



# 2

Christ, the blessèd One, gives to all

wonderful words of life;

Sinner, list to the loving call,

wonderful words of life;

All so freely given,

wooing us to heaven.



# 3

Sweetly echo the Gospel call,

wonderful words of life;

Offer pardon and peace to all,

wonderful words of life;

Jesus, only Savior,

sanctify forever.
