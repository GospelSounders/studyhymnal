# 1

And must I part with all of self,

My dearest Lord, for thee?

It is but right since thou hast done

Much more than this for me.



# 2

Yes, let it go; one look from thee

Will more than make amends

For all the losses I sustain

Of honor, riches, friends.



# 3

Ten thousand worlds, ten thousand lives,

How worthless they appear

Compared with thee, supremely good,

Divinely bright and fair!
