1.

Down life's dark vale we wander,

Till Jesus comes;

We watch and wait and wonder,

Till Jesus comes.



Chorus

All joy His lov'd ones bringing,

When Jesus comes;

All praise thro' heaven ringing,

When Jesus comes.

All beauty bright and vernal,

When Jesus comes;

All glory, grand, eternal,

When Jesus comes.



2.

Oh, may my lamp be burning

When Jesus comes;

For Him my soul be yearning,

When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]



3.

No more heart pangs nor sadness,

When Jesus comes;

All peace and joy and gladness,

When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]



4.

All doubts and fears will vanish,

When Jesus comes;

All gloom His face will banish,

When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]



5.

He'll know the way was dreary,

When Jesus comes;

He'll know the feet grew weary,

When Jesus comes. [Chorus]



6.

He'll know what griefs oppressed me,

When Jesus comes;

Oh, how His arms will rest me!

When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]
