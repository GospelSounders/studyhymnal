# 1

To God be the glory, great things He hath done,

So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,

Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,

And opened the Life-gate that all may go in.



Chorus:

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,

Let the earth hear His voice;

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, 

Let the people rejoice;

O come to the Father, thro' Jesus the Son

And give Him the glory great things He hath done.



# 2

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,

To ev'ry believer the promise of God;

The vilest offender who truly believes,

That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.  [Chorus]



# 3

Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,

And great our rejoicing thro' Jesus the Son;

But purer, and higher, and greater will be

Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.  [Chorus]
