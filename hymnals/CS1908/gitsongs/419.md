# 1

Jesus, these eyes have never seen

That radiant form of Thine;

The vail of sense hangs dark between

Thy blessed face and mine.



# 2

I see Thee not, I hear Thee not,

Yet art Thou oft with me;

And earth has ne'er so dear a spot,

As where I meet with Thee.



# 3

Like some bright dream that comes unsought,

When slumbers o'er me roll,

Thine image ever fills my tho't,

And charms my ravished soul.



# 4

Yet tho' I have not seen, and still

Must rest in faith alone,

I love Thee, dearest Lord, and will,

Unseen, but not known.
