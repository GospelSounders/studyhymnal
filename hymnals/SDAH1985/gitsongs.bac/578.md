# 1

So sent I you- by grace made strong to triumph

O’er hosts of hell, o’er darkness, death, and sin,

My name to bear, and in that name to conquer-

So send I you, My victory to win.



# 2

So send I you- to take to souls in bondage

The word of truth that sets the captive fee,

To break the bonds of sin, to loose dearth’s fetters-

So send I you, to bring the lost to Me.



# 3

So send I you- My strength to know in weakness,

My joy in grief, my perfect peace in pain,

To prove My power, My grace, My promised presence-

So send I you, eternal fruit to gain.



# 4

So Send I you – to bear My cross with patience,

And then one day with joy to lay it down

To hear My voice, “Well done, My faithful servant –

Come, share My throne, My Kingdom, and My crown!”

As the Father hath sent Me, so send I You.”
