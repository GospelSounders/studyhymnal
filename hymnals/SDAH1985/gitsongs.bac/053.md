# 1

All praise to thee, my God, this night,

for all the blessings of the light!

Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,

beneath thine own almighty wings.



# 2

Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear Son,

the ill that I this day have done,

that with the world, myself, and thee,

I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.



# 3

O may my soul on thee repose,

and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close,

sleep that may me more vigorous make

to serve my God when I awake.



# 4

Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;

praise him, all creatures here below;

praise him above, ye heavenly host;

praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
