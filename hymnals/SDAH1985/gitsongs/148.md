# 1

O love, how deep, how broad, how high,

Beyond all thought and fantasy,

That God, the Son of God, should take

Our mortal form for mortal’s sake!



# 2

For us baptized, for us He bore

His holy fast and hungered sore;

For us temptation sharp He knew;

For us the tempter overthrew.



# 3

For us by wickedness betrayed,

For us, in crown of thorns arrayed,

He bore the shameful cross and death;

For us He gave His dying breath.



# 4

For us He rose from death again,

For us He went on high to reign;

For us He sent His Spirit here

To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.



# 5

All glory to our Lord and God

For love so deep, so high, so broad;

The Trinity whom we adore

Forevermore and forevermore.
