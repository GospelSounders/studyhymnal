# 1

All to Jesus I surrender,

All to Him I freely give;

I will ever love and trust Him,

In His presence daily live;



Chorus:

I surrender all,

I surrender all;

All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,

I surrender all.



# 2

All to Jesus I surrender,

Humbly at His feet I bow;

Worldly pleasures all forsaken,

Take me, Jesus, take me now;  [Chorus]



# 3

All to Jesus I surrender,

Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine;

Let me feel the Holy Spirit,

Truly know that Thou art mine;  [Chorus]



# 4

All to Jesus I surrender,

Now I feel the sacred flame,

O the joy of full salvation!

Glory, glory to His name!  [Chorus]
