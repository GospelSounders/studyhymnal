# 1

Nature with open volume stands,

To spread its Maker’s praise abroad;

And every labor of His hands

Shows something worthy of our God.



# 2

But in the grace that rescued us

His brightest form of glory shines;

‘Tis fairest drawn upon the cross

In precious blood and crimson lines.



# 3

Here His whole name appears complete.

Nor wit can guess, nor reason prove,

Which of the letters best is writ,

The pow’r, the wisdom, or the love.



# 4

We would forever speak His name

In sounds to mortal ears unknown,

With angels join to praise the Lamb,

And worship at His Father’s throne.
