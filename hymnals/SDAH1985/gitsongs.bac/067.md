# 1

O Lord, now let Your servant

Depart in heav’nly peace,

For I have seen the glory

Of Your redeeming grace:

A light to lead the Gentiles

Unto Your holy hill,

The glory of Your people,

Your chosen Israel.



# 2

Then grant that I may follow Your gleam,

O glorious Light,

Till earthly shadows scatter,

And faith is changed to sight;

Till raptured saints shall gather

Upon that shining shore,

Where Christ, the blessed Day star,

Shall light them evermore.
