# 1

There is no name so sweet on earth,

No name so sweet in heaven,

The name before his wondrous birth

To Christ the Saviour given.



Refrain:

We love to sing around our King,

And hail him blessed Jesus;

For there's no word ear ever heard

So dear, so sweet, as Jesus.



# 2

And when he hung upon the tree,

They wrote this name above him,

That all might see the reason we

For evermore must love him.  [Refrain]



# 3

So now, upon his Father's throne,

Almighty to release us

From sin and pains, he ever reigns,

The Prince and Saviour, Jesus.  [Refrain]
