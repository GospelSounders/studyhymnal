# 1

All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name!

Let angels prostrate fall;

Bring forth the royal diadem,

And crown Him Lord of all;

Bring forth the royal diadem,

And crown Him Lord of all.



# 2

Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,

A remnant weak and small,

Hail Him who saves you by His grace,

And crown Him Lord of all;

Hail Him who saves you by His grace,

And crown Him Lord of all.



# 3

Let ev'ry kindred, ev'ry tribe,

On this terrestrial ball,

To Him all majesty ascribe,

And crown Him Lord of all;

To Him all majesty ascribe,

And crown Him Lord of all.



# 4

O that with yonder sacred throng,

We at His feet may fall;

We'll join the everlasting song,

And crown Him Lord of all;

We'll join the everlasting song,

And crown Him Lord of all.
