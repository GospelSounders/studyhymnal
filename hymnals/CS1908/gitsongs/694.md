# 1

O Christian, if the needy poor

Have e'er unheeded been,

Beware, lest at thy closed door

The Saviour stood unseen!

Let heart and house be open thrown,

Thy gifts with others share;

Let holy charity be shown

To all who need thy care.



# 2

Then, while thy glance abroad is cast,

The Lord is by thy side;

For thro' the open door He passed,

When they were not denied.

And ere thy kindly heart could guess

Who entered by the door,

His gracious hands were raised to bless

Thy basket and thy store.



# 3

And He shall bless thee all life's day,

With His almighty love;

And crown thee in eternity

That waits the just above,

Where soon the pearly gates of light

His hand shall open throw

To all who now with Him unite

In ministry below.
