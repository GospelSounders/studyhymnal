# 1

O for a thousand tongues to sing

My great Redeemer's praise!

The glories of my God and King,

The triumphs of his grace,

The triumphs of his grace.



# 2

Jesus, the name that calms our fears,

That bids our sorrows cease,

'Tis music in the sinner's ears,

'Tis life, and health, and peace,

'Tis life, and health, and peace.



# 3

He breaks the pow'r of cancelled sin,

He sets the pris'ner free;

His blood can make the foulest clean

His blood avails for me,

His blood avails for me.



# 4

He speaks, and list'ning to his voice,

New life the dead receive;

The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,

The humble poor believe,

The humble poor believe.
