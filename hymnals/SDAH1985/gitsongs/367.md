# 1

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,

snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;

weep o’er the erring one, lift up the fallen,

tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.



# Refrain

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;

Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.



# 2

Though they are slighting him, still he is waiting,

waiting the penitent child to receive;

plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;

he will forgive if they only believe.



# 3

Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;

strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;

back to the narrow way patiently win them;

tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.
