1.

Blessed Bible, how I love it!

How it doth my bosom cheer!

What hath earth like this to covet?

O, what stores of wealth are here!



2.

'Tis a fountain ever bursting,

Whence the weary may obtain

Water for the soul that's thirsting,

That it may not thirst again.



3.

'Tis a chart that never faileth,

One which God to man has giv'n;

And tho' oft the storm assaileth,

It will guide us safe to heav'n.



4.

'Tis a pearl of price exceeding

All the gems in ocean found;

All its sacred precepts heeding,

So shall we in grace abound.
