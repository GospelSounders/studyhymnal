# 1

I gave my life for Thee,

My precious blood I shed,

That Thou might'st ransom'd be,

And quicken'd from the dead,

I gave, I gave my life for Thee,

What has thou giv'n for me?

I gave, I gave my life for Thee,

What hast Thou giv'n for me?



# 2

My Father's house of light,

My glory circled throne,

I left for earthly night,

For wand'rings sad and lone;

I left, I left it all for Thee,

Hast Thou left aught for me?

I left, I left it all for Thee,

Hast Thou left aught for me?



# 3

I suffered much for Thee,

More than Thy tongue can tell,

Of bitt'rest agony,

To rescue Thee from hell;

I've borne, I've borne it all for Thee,

What hast Thou borne for me?

I've borne, I've borne it all for Thee,

What hast Thou borne for me?
