# 1

He's coming once again,

To set his people free;

That where he is, in glory bright,

His saints may also be.

Then lift the drooping head.

Look up, rejoice and sing;

He comes in majesty sublime,

Salvation's glorious King!



# 2

The earth shall quake with fear,

The heav'ns shall flee away;

And where shall guilty man appear

In that tremendous day?

No refuge then is night,

No shelter from the blast;

The night of vengeance vails the sky

When mercy's day is past.



# 3

His eyes of living flame,

The wicked shall devour;

No tongue will lightly speak the name

Of Jesus in that hour.

No scorn, no words of hate,

For his meek foll'wers then;

But prayers and tears that come too late,

Will mark earth's mighty men.
