# 1

I hear the Saviour say,

"Thy strength indeed is small;

Child of weakness, watch and pray,

Find in me thine all in all."



Refrain:

Jesus paid it all,

All to him I owe;

Sin had left a crimson stain:

He washed it white as snow.



# 2

Lord, now indeed I find

Thy pow'r, and thine alone,

Can change the leper's spots,

And melt the heart of stone.  [Refrain]



# 3

Since nothing good have I

Whereby thy grace to claim,

I'll wash my garments white

In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.  [Refrain]



# 4

And when before the throne

I stand in him complete,

I'll lay my trophies down,

All down at Jesus' feet.  [Refrain]
