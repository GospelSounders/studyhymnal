# 1

Praise to Him by whose kind favor

Heav'nly truth has reached our ears;

May its sweet reviving savor

Fill our hearts and calm our fears.



# 2

Truth!  how sacred is the treasure!

Teach us, Lord, its worth to know;

Vain the hope, and short the pleasure

Which from other sources flow.



# 3

What of truth we have been hearing,

Fix, O Lord, in ev'ry heart;

In the day of thy appearing

May we share thy people's part.
