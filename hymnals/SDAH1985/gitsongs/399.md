# 1

Beneath the forms of outward rite

Thy supper, Lord, is spread

In every quiet upper room

Where fainting souls are fed.



# 2

The bread is always consecrate

Which men divide with men;

And every act of brotherhood

Repeats Thy feast again.



# 3

The blessed cup is only passed

True memory of Thee,

When life anew pours out its wine

With rich sufficiency.



# 4

O Master, through these symbols shared,

Thine own dear self impart,

That in our daily life may flame

The passion of Thy heart.
