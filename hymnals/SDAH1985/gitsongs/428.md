# 1

There’s a land that is fairer than day,

And by faith we can see it afar;

For the Father waits over the way

To prepare us a dwelling place there.



# Refrain

In the sweet in the sweet

By and by by and by,

We shall meet on that beautiful shore;

In the sweet in the sweet

By and by by and by

We shall meet on that beautiful shore.



# 2

We shall sing on that beautiful shore

The melodious songs of the blest,

And our spirits shall sorrow no more

Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.



# 3

To our bountiful father above

We will offer our tribute of praise;

For the glorious gift of His love

And the blessings that hallow our days.
