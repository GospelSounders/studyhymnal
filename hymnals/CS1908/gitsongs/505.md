# 1

The Lord's our Rock, in him we hide,

A shelter in the time of storm;

Secure whatever may betide,

A shelter in the time of storm.



Chorus:

Mighty Rock in a weary land,

Cooling Shade on the burning sand,

Faithful Guide for the pilgrim band,

A shelter in the time of storm.



# 2

A shade by day, defence by night,

A shelter in the time of storm;

No fears alarm, no foes affright,

A shelter in the time of storm.  [Chorus]



# 3

The raging floods may round us beat,

A shelter in the time of storm;

We find in God a safe retreat,

A shelter in the time of storm.  [Chorus]



# 4

O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,

A shelter in the time of storm;

Be thou our helper, ever near,

A shelter in the time of storm.  [Chorus]
