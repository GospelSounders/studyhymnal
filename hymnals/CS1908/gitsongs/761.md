1.

God make my life a little light 

Within the world to glow.

A little flame that burneth bright,

Wherever I may go.



2.

God make my life a little flow'r,

That giveth joy to all,

Content to bloom in native bow'r,

Altho' the place be small.



3.

God make my life a little song

That comforteth the sad;

That helpeth others to be strong,

And makes the singer glad.



4.

God make my life a little staff,

Whereon the weak may rest,

That so what health and strength I have

May serve my neighbors best.
