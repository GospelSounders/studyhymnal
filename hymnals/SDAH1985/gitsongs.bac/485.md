# 1

I must tell Jesus all of my trials,

I cannot bear these burdens alone;

In my distress He kindly will help me,

He ever loves and cares for His own.



# Refrain

I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!

I cannot bear my burdens alone;

I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!

Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.



# 2

I must tell Jesus all of my troubles,

He is a kind, compassionate Friend;

If I but ask Him He will deliver,

Make of my troubles quickly an end.



# 3

Oh, how the world to evil allures me!

Oh, how my heart is tempted to sin!

I must tell Jesus, and He will help me

Over the world the vict’ry to win.
