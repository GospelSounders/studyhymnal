# 1

‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,

and to take him at his word;

just to rest upon his promise,

and to know, “Thus saith the Lord.”



# Refrain

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!

How I’ve proved him o’er and o’er!

Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!

O for grace to trust him more!



# 2

O how sweet to trust in Jesus,

just to trust his cleansing blood;

and in simple faith to plunge me

neath the healing, cleansing flood!



# 3

Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,

just from sin and self to cease;

just from Jesus simply taking

life and rest, and joy and peace.



# 4

I’m so glad I learned to trust thee,

precious Jesus, Savior, friend;

and I know that thou art with me,

wilt be with me to the end.
