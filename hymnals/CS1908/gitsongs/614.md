# 1

Saviour!  Thy dying love 

Thou gavest me,

Nor should I aught withhold, 

Dear Lord, from Thee;

In love my soul would bow,

My heart fulfill its vow,

Some off'ring bring Thee now,

Something for Thee.



# 2

At the blest mercy-seat, 

Pleading for me,

My feeble faith looks up, 

Jesus to Thee;

Help me the cross to bear,

Thy wondrous love declare,

Some song to raise, or pray'r,

Something for Thee.



# 3

Give me a faithful heart,

Likeness to Thee,

That each departing day 

henceforth may see;

Some work of love begun,

Some deed of kindness done,

Some wand'rer sought and won,

Something for Thee.



# 4

All that I am and have, 

Thy gifts so free,

In joy, in grief, thro' life, 

Dear Lord, for Thee!

And when Thy face I see, 

My ransom'd soul shall be,

Thro' all eternity,

Something for Thee.
