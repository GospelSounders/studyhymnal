# 1

I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above,

Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love:

The love that asks the reason, the love that stands the test,

That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;

The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,

The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.



# 2

And there’s another country, I’ve heard of long ago,

Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;

We may not count her armies, we may not see her King;

Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;

And one by one and fervently we pray for her increase,

And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.
