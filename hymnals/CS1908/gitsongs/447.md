# 1

Once more, my soul, the rising day

Salutes thy waking eye;

Once more, my voice, thy tribute, pay

To Him who rules on high.



# 2

Night unto night His name repeats,

The day renews the sound,

Wide as the heav'ns on which He sits

To turn the seasons round.



# 3

O God, may all my hours be thine,

While I enjoy the light;

Then shall my sun in smiles decline,

And bring a peaceful night.
