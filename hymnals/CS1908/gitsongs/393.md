# 1

When all thy mercies, O my God!

My rising soul surveys,

Transported with the view, 

I'm lost in wonder, love, and praise.



# 2

Unnumbered comforts to my soul

Thy tender care bestowed,

Before my infant heart discerned

From whom those blessings flowed.



# 3

Ten thousand thousand precious gifts

My daily thanks employ;

Nor is the least a cheerful heart,

That tastes these gifts with joy.



# 4

O, how can words with equal warmth

The gratitude declare

That glows within my raptured heart?

But thou canst read it there.



# 5

Through all eternity, to thee

A joyful song I'll raise:

But O, eternity's too short

To utter all thy praise!
