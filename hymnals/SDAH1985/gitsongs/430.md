# 1

O there’ll be joy when the work is done,

Joy when the reapers gather home,

Bringing the sheaves at set of sun

To the New Jerusalem.



# Refrain

Joy, joy, joy, there’ll be joy by and by,

Joy, joy, joy, where the joys never die;

Joy, joy, joy, for the day draweth nigh

When the workers gather home.



# 2

Sweet are the songs that we hope to sing,

Grateful the thanks our hearts shall bring,

Praising forever Christ our King

In the New Jerusalem.



# 3

Pure are the joys that await us there,

Many the golden mansions fair;

Jesus Himself doth them prepare,

In the New Jerusalem.
