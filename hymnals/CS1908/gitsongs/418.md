# 1

Come, O my soul, in sacred lays,

Attempt thy great Creator's praise;

But O what tongue can speak his fame!

What mortal verse declare his name!



# 2

 Enthroned amid the radiant spheres,

He glory like a garment wears;

To form a robe of light divine,

Ten thousand suns around him shine.



# 3

Raised on devotion's lofty wing,

Do thou, my soul, his glories sing;

And let his praise employ thy tongue

Till list'ning worlds shall join the song.
