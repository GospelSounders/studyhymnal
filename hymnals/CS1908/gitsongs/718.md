# 1

The world is very evil,

The times are waxing late;

Be sober and keep vigil;

The Judge is at the gate,

The Judge who comes in mercy,

The Judge who comes with might,

Who comes to end the evil,

Who comes to crown the right.



# 2

Arise, arise, O Christian,

Let right to wrong succeed;

Let penitential sorrow

To heavenly gladness lead,

To light that has no evening,

That knows no moon nor sea,

The light so fair and golden,

Of Christ, the sinless One.



# 3

Behold, the morn shall waken,

And shadows shall decay,

And each true-hearted servant

Shall shine as does the day;

And God, our King and Portion,

In fulnesss of his grace,

Shall we behold forever,

And worship face to face.
