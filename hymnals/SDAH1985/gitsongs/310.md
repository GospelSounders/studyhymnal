I would draw nearer to Jesus, In His sweet presence abide,

Constantly trying to serve Him, Safe and secure at His side.

Fully surrendered each moment, I would draw nearer to Him.

Knowing He loves to be gracious, I would draw nearer to Him.

Fully surrendered each moment, I would draw nearer to Him.

I would draw nearer to Jesus, Seeking Hi strength to be true,

Willing to tell of His goodness, Gladly His blest will to do.
