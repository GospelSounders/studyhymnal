# 1

Father, I stretch my hands to Thee;

No other help I know;

If Thou withdraw Thyself from me,

Ah, wither shall I go?



# 2

On Thy dear Son I now believe,

O let me feel Thy power;

And all my varied wants relieve,

In this accepted hour.



# 3

Author of faith! To Thee I lift

My weary, longing eyes;

O let me now receive that gift;

My soul without it dies.



# 4

Surely Thou canst not let me die;

O speak, and I shall live;

And here I will unwearied lie,

Till Thou Thy Spirit give.



# 5

How would my fainting soul rejoice

Could I but see Thy face!

Now let me hear Thy quickening voice,

And taste Thy pardoning grace.



# 6

I do believe, I now believe

That Jesus died for me,

And that He shed His precious blood

From sin to set me free.
