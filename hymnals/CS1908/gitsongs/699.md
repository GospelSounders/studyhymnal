# 1

In the vineyard of our Father, 

Daily work we find to do;

Scatter'd gleanings we may gather,

Though we are but young and few;

Little clusters, Little clusters,

Help to fill the garners too.



# 2

Toiling early in the morning.

Catching moments thro' the day,

Nothing small or lowly scorning

While we work, and watch, and pray

Gath'ring gladly  Gath'ring gladly

Free-will off'rings by the way.
