# 1

Not all the blood of beasts

On Jewish altars slain,

Could give the guilty conscience peace,

Or wash away the stain.



# 2

But Christ, the heav'nly Lamb,

Takes all our sins away;

A sacrifice of nobler name

And rich blood than they.



# 3

My faith would lay her hand

On that dear head of thine,

While like a penitent I stand,

And there confess my sin.
