1.

Gentle Peace, from heav'n descended,

We would live beneath thy law;

Thou hast home and life befriended

Born of nobler deeds than war.



2.

Thou hast thrown a smile of beauty

O'er the meadow, hill, and grove;

Thou hast quickened us to duty,

Thou hast warmed our hearts to love.



3.

Stay thou with us, still replenish

Fields with fruit, ourselves with love;

Discord and dissension banish,

Peaceful spirits from above.
