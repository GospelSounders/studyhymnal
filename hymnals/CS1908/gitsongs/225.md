225 – Washed White As Snow


1
Tho' my sins were once like crimson red,
To the healing stream my feet were led;
In the precious blood my Saviour shed
He washed me white as snow.

Chorus:
O my joyful song henceforth shall be,
" 'Tis the blood of Jesus cleanseth me,
Cleanseth, cleanseth, 
O, yes, it cleanseth me."

2
At the door of faith I entered in,
And to him confessed my guilt and sin;
With his own dear hand he washed me clean,
He washed me white as snow.  [Chorus]

3
Tho' my heart was all I had to give,
Yet he smiled and bade me look and live;
What a calm, sweet peace did I receive!
He washed me white as snow.  [Chorus]

4
I will sing his pow'r from death to save,
I will sing his triumph o'er the grave,
I will sing beyond death's chilling wave,
"He washed me white as snow."  [Chorus]
