# 1

There’s a song in the air!

There’s a star in the sky!

There’s a mother’s deep prayer

And a baby’s low cry!

And the star rains its fire

while the beautiful sing,

For the manger of Bethlehem

cradles a King!



# 2

There’s a tumult of joy

O’er the wonderful birth,

For the virgin’s sweet boy

Is the Lord of the earth.

Aye! the star rains its fire

while the beautiful sing,

For the manger of Bethlehem

cradles a King!



# 3

In the light of that star

Lie the ages impearled;

And that song from afar

Has swept over the world.

Every hearth is aflame

and the beautiful sing

In the homes of the nations

that Jesus is King!



# 4

We rejoice in the light,

And we echo the song

That comes down through the night

From the heavenly throng.

Aye! we shout to the lovely evangel they bring,

And we greet in His cradle

our Savior and King!
