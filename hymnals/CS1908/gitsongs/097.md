# 1

Not saved are we by trying,

From self can come no aid;

'Tis on the blood relying,

Once for our ransom paid;

'Tis looking unto Jesus,

The holy One and just;

'Tis His great work that saves us,

It is not Try, but Trust.



Chorus:  It is not Try, but Trust,

It is not Try, but Trust; 

'Tis His great work that saves us;

It is not Try, but Trust.



# 2

'Twas vain for Israel bitten

By serpents on their way,

To look to their own doing,

That awful plague to stay;

The remedy and healing,

When humbled in the dust,

Was of the Lord's revealing,

It is not Try, but Trust.  [Chorus]



# 3

No deeds of ours are needed

To make Christ's merit more;

No frames of mind, or feelings,

Can add to His great store;

'Tis simply to receive Him,

The holy One and just,

'Tis only to believe Him,

It is not Try, but Trust.  [Chorus]
