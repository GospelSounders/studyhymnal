# 1

The Lord first empties whom he fills,

Casts down whom he would raise;

He quickens when the letter kills,

Exalting thus his praise.

When he applies his healing blood

Unto a sin-sick soul,

This balsam, pow'rful, precious, good,

Ne'er fails to make it whole.



# 2

On us he spent his life and blood,

Our losses to retrieve;

Mankind's redemption now holds good

For sinners who believe.

Lord, I believe!  whate'er befall,

A thankful heart be mine,

A heart that answers to thy call,

One that is wholly thine.
