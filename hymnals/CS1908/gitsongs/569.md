# 1

I wash'd my hands this morning,

O very clean and white,

And lent them both to Jesus,

To work for him till night.



Chorus:

Little feet, be careful,

Where you take me to,

Anything for Jesus,

Only let me do.



# 2

I told my ears to listen

Quite closely all day thro',

For any act of kindness,

Such little hands can do.  [Chorus]



# 3

My eyes are set to watch them

About their work or play,

To keep them out of mischief,

For Jesus' sake all day.  [Chorus]
