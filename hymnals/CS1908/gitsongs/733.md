# 1

Tossed upon life's raging billow.

Sweet it is, O Lord, to know

Thou didst press a sailor's pillow.

Thou canst feel a sailor's woe;

Never slumb'ring, never sleeping.

Tho' the night be dark and drear,

Thou the faithful watch art keeping;

"All is well," thy constant cheer.



# 2

Thou my heart the hope will cherish,

While to thee I lift mine eye,

Thou wilt save me o'er I perish,

Thou wilt hear the sailor's cry;

And the mast and sail be riven,

Soon life's voyage will be o'er;

Safely moored in heav'n's wide haven,

Storm and temptest vex no more.
