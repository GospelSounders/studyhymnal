# 1

Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee,

These children dear of mine, Thou gavest me;

O, by Thy love divine, Lead them, my God, to Thee;

Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.



# 2

When earth looks bright and fair, Festive and gay,

Let no delusive snare Lure them astray;

But from temptation’s power, Lead them, my God, to Thee,

Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.



# 3

E’en for such little ones, Christ came a child,

And in this world of sin Lived undefiled.

O, for His sake, I pray, Lead them, my God, to Thee,

Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.



# 4

Yea, though my faith be dim, I would believe

That Thou this precious gift Wilt now receive;

O take their young hearts now, Lead them my God to Thee,

Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.
