# 1

Grant thy blessing, now, O Lord,

While we look into thy word:

To our hearts thy truth reveal;

Fill us with a holy zeal;

As we learn thy righteous way,

Give us power to obey.



# 2

Sanctify us, Lord, we pray,

By the lessons of this day:

May our souls by thee be fed,

And to living fountains led;

In a world of care and sin,

Keep us ever pure within.
