# 1

Redeemed!  how I love to proclaim it!

Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;

Redeemed thro' his infinite mercy,

His child, and forever, I am.  



Refrain:

Redeemed, redeemed,

Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;

Redeemed, redeemed,

His child, and forever, I am.



# 2

Redeemed!  and so happy in Jesus!

No language my rapture can tell;

I know that the light of his presence

With me doth continually dwell.  [Refrain]



# 3

I think of my blessed Redeemer,

I think of him all the day long;

I sing; for I cannot be silent;

His love is the theme of my song.  [Refrain]



# 4

I know I shall see in his beauty

The King in whose law I delight,

Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,

And giveth me songs in the night.  [Refrain]



# 5

I know there's a crown that is waiting

In yonder bright mansion for me;

And soon, with the spirits made perfect,

At home with the Lord I shall be.  [Refrain]
