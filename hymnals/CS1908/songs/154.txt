154 â€“ Depths of Mercy


1
Depth of mercy!  can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God his wrath forbear?
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

2
I have long withstood his grace,
Long provoked him to his face,
Would not hearken to his calls,
Griev'd him by a thousand falls.

3
There for me the Saviour stands,
Shows his wounds and spreads his hands;
God is love!  I know, I feel;
Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
