# 1

I've two little hands to work for Jesus,

One little tongue his praise to tell,

Two little ears to hear his counsel,

One little voice a song to swell.



Chorus:

Lord, we come, Lord, we come,

In our childhood's early morning,

Lord, we come, Lord, we come,

Come to learn of thee.



# 2

I've two little feet to tread the pathway

Up to the heav'nly courts above;

Two little eyes to read the Bible,

Telling of Jesus' wondrous love.  [Chorus]



# 3

I've one little heart to give to Jesus,

One little soul for him to save,

One little life for his dear service,

One little self that he must have.  [Chorus]
