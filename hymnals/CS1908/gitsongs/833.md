1.

How shall I follow Him I serve?

How shall I copy Him I love?

Nor from those blessed footsteps swerve

Which lead me to His seat above?



2.

Lord, should my path thro' suffering lie,

Forbid that I should e'er repine;

Still let me turn to Calvary,

Nor heed my grief, rememb'ring Thine.



3.

O let me think, how Thou didst leave

Thy heav'nly home of pure delights,

To fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve,

Thro' toilsome days, thro' lonely nights!



4.

All this Thou didst, then died for me!

Thou camest not Thyself to please;

And, dear tho' earthly comforts be,

Shall I not love Thee more then these?
