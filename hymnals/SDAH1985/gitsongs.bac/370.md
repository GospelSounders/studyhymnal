# 1

Christ for the world we sing,

the world to Christ we bring,

with loving zeal;

the poor, and them that mourn,

the faint and overborne,

sinsick and sorrow-worn,

whom Christ doth heal.



# 2

Christ for the world we sing,

the world to Christ we bring,

with fervent prayer;

the wayward and the lost,

by restless passions tossed,

redeemed at countless cost,

from dark despair.



# 3

Christ for the world we sing,

the world to Christ we bring,

with joyful song;

the newborn souls, whose days,

reclaimed from error’s ways,

inspired with hope and praise,

to Christ belong.
