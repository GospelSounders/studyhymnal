# 1

Break thou the bread of life, dear Lord, to me,

as thou didst break the loaves beside the sea;

beyond the sacred page I seek thee, Lord;

my spirit pants for thee, O Living Word!



# 2

Bless thou the truth, dear Lord, to me, to me,

as thou didst bless the bread by Galilee;

then shall all bondage cease, all fetters fall;

and I shall find my peace, my all in all.



# 3

Thou art the bread of life, O Lord, to me;

Thy holy Word the truth That saveth me;

Give me to eat and live With Thee above;

Teach me to love Thy truth, For Thou art love.



# 4

Spirit and life are they, Words Thou dost speak;

I hasten to obey, But I am weak;

Thou art my only help, Thou art my life;

Heeding Thy holy Word I win the strife.
