# 1

Holy, holy, holy!  Lord God Almighty!

Early in the morning our song shall rise to thee;

Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!

God over all, who rules eternity.



# 2

Holy, holy, holy!  angels adore thee,

Casting down their bright crowns around the glassy sea;

Thousands and ten thousands worship low before thee,

Which wert and art and evermore shalt be.



# 3

Holy, holy, holy!  though darkness hide thee,

Though the eye of man thy great glory may not see;

Only thou art holy; there is none beside thee,

Perfect in power, in love and purity.
