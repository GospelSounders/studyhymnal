# 1

I would be, dear Savior, wholly Thine;

Teach me how, teach me how;

I would do Thy will, O Lord, not mine;

Help me, help me now.



# Refrain

Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,

Wholly Thine, this is my vow;

Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,

Wholly Thine, O Lord, just now.



# 2

What is worldly pleasure, wealth or fame,

Without Thee, without Thee?

I will leave them all for Thy dear Name,

This my wealth shall be.



# 3

As I cast earth’s transient joys behind,

Come Thou near, come Thou near;

In Thy presence all in all I find,

’Tis my comfort here.
