# 1

O let me walk with Thee, my God,

As Enoch walked in days of old;

Place Thou my trembling hand in Thine,

And sweet communion with me hold;

E’en though the path I may not see,

Yet, Jesus, let me walk with Thee.



# 2

I cannot, dare not, walk alone;

The tempest rages in the sky,

A thousand snares beset my feet,

A thousand foes are lurking nigh.

Still Thou the raging of the sea,

O Master! let me walk with Thee.



# 3

If I may rest my hand in Thine,

I’ll count the joys of earth but loss,

And firmly, bravely journey on;

I’ll bear the banner of the cross

Till Zion’s glorious gates I see;

Yet, Savior, let me walk with Thee.
