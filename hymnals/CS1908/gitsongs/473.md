# 1

Around the world the chorus rings,

And hands are joined with hands;

A Brotherhood of Service sings

In all the happy lands;

United sounds the watchword still

That ever has sufficed; 

"The will, the will, the blessed will!

The will of Jesus Christ!"



# 2

In crowded town or lonely plain,

'Mid many friends or few,

With man's applause or man's disdain,

To one allegiance true,

That sole desire their hearts could fill,

Tho' all the earth enticed;

The will, the will, the precious will!

The will of Jesus Christ!"



# 3

When proud Ambition gilds her goal,

When Ease to slumber calls,

When silken Mammon lures the soul

To rainbow-tinted halls,

The Brotherhood of Service still

Exalts the Pearl unpriced;

The will, the will, the holy will!

The will of Jesus Christ!"



# 4

And when at last the golden years

Have brought the crowning day,

When toil and trial, pain and fears,

Forever pass away,

Upon the summit of the hill

Is One that keepeth tryst;

'Tis He, the Will, the living Will!  

Our Master, Jesus Christ!"
