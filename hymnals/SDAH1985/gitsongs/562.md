# 1

Come, sing a song of harvest, Of thanks for daily food!

To offer God the first-fruits is old as gratitude.



# 2

Long, long ago, the reapers, before they kept the feast,

Put first-fruits in a basket, and took it to the priest.



# 3

Shall we, sometimes forgetful oh where creation starts,

With science in our pockets lose wonder from our hearts?



# 4

May God, the great Creator, to whom all life belongs,

Accept these gifts we offer, our service and our songs.



# 5

And lest the world go hungry while we ourselves are fed,

Make each of us more ready to share our daily bread.
