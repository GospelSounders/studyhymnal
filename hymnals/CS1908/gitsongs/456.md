# 1

How pleasant, how divinely fair,

O Lord of hosts, thy dwellings are!

With long desire my spirit faints

To meet th' assemblies of the saints.



# 2

Blest are the souls that find a place

Within the temple of thy grace;

There they behold thy gentle rays,

And seek thy face and learn thy praise.



# 3

Blest are the men whose hearts are set

To find the way to Zion's gate;

God is their strength; and thro' the road

They lean upon their helper, God.
