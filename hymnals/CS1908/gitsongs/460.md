# 1

Sweetly the holy hymn

Breaks on the morning air;

Before the world with smoke is dim,

We meet to offer prayer.



# 2

While flow'rs are wet with dews,

Dew of our souls, descend;

Ere yet the sun the day renews,

O Lord, Thy Spirit send.



# 3

Upon the battlefield,

Before the fight begins,

We seek, O Lord, Thy shelt'ring shield,

To guard us from our sins.



# 4

On the lone mountain side,

Before the morning's light,

The Man of sorrows wept and cried,

And rose refreshed with might.



# 5

Oh, hear us then, for we

Are very weak and frail,

We make the Saviour's name our plea,

And surely must prevail.
