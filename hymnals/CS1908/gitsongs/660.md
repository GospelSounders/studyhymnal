# 1

My Jesus, as thou wilt:

O may thy will be mine!

Into thy hand of love 

I would, my all resign.

Thro' sorrow or thro' joy,

Conduct me as thine own,

And help me still to say,

"My Lord, thy will be done."



# 2

My Jesus, as thou wilt:

Tho' seen thro' many a tear,

Let not my star of hope

Grow dim or disappear.

Since thou on earth hast wept

And sorrowed oft alone,

If I must weep with thee,

"My Lord, thy will be done."



# 3

My Jesus, as thou wilt:

All shall be well for me;

Each changing future scene

I gladly trust with thee.

Straight to my home above,

I travel calmly on,

And sing in life or death,

"My Lord, thy will be done."
