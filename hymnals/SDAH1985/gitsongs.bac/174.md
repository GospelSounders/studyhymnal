# 1

Star of our hope! He’ll soon appear,

The last loud trumpet speaks Him near;

Hail Him, all saints, from pole to pole-

How welcome to the faithful soul!



# 2

From heaven angelic voices sound:

Behold the Lord of glory crowned,

Arrayed in majesty divine,

And in His highest glories shine.



# 3

The grave yields up its precious trust,

Which long has slumbered in the dust,

Resplendent forms ascending, fair,

Now meet the Savior in the air.



# 4

Descending with His azure throne,

He claims the kingdom for His own;

The saints rejoice, they shout, they sing,

And hail Him their triumphant King.
