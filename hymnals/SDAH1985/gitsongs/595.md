# 1

Let every lamp be burning bright,

The darkest hour is nearing;

The darkest hour of earth’s long night,

Before the Lord’s appearing.



# Refrain

Then trim your lamps, my brethren dear,

Then trim your lamps with godly fear;

The Master’s coming draweth near,

Let every lamp be burning.



# 2

Though thousands calmly slumber on,

The last great message spuring,

Wel’ll rest our living faith upon

His promise of returning.



# 3

His word our lamp, His truth our guide,

We cannot be mistaken;

Though dangers rise on every side,

We shall not be forsaken.



# 4

Then let good works with faith appear,

To help the world atound us;

Obedience bring the blessing near

When faith has firmly bound us.
