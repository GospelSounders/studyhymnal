# 1

Again the day awake in wondrous beauty,

And all the shadows of the midnight flee.

Again we gird ourselves for loving duty,

And lift our thankful hearts, O God, to thee.



# 2

Look from the height of heav'n, and send to cheer us

Thy light and truth, and guide us onward still;

O let thy mercy, as of old, be near us,

And lead us safely to thy holy hill.



# 3

So, when that morn of endless light is waking,

And shades of evil from its splendors flee,

Safe may we rise, this earth's dark vale forsaking,

Thro' all the long, bright day to dwell with thee.
