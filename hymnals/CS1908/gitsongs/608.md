# 1

Sweet Sabbath School!  more dear to me

Than fairest palace dome,

My heart e'er turns with joy to thee,

My own dear Sabbath Home.



Chorus:

Sabbath home!  blessed home!

Sabbath home!  blessed home!

My heart o'er turns with joy to thee,

My own dear Sabbath Home.



# 2

Here first my wilful, wand'ring heart,

The way of life was shown,

Here first I sought the better part,

And gained a Sabbath Home.  [Chorus]



# 3

Here Jesus stood with loving voice,

Entreating me to come,

And make of Him my only choice,

In this dear Sabbath Home.  [Chorus]
