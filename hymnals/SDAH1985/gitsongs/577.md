# 1

In the heart of Jesus there is love for you,

Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;

Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,

When the heart of Jesus has a full supply?



# 2

In the mind of Jesus there is thought for you,

Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;

Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,

Since the mind of Jesus cares for those He bought?



# 3

In the field of Jesus there is work for you;

Such as even angels might rejoice to do;

Why stand idly sighing for some lifework grand,

While the field of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?



# 4

In the home of Jesus there’s a place for you;

Glorious, bright, and joyous, calm and peaceful too;

Why then, like a wanderer, roam with weary pace,

If the home of Jesus holds for you a place?
