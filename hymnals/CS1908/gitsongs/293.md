# 1

In the blood from the cross

I have been wash'd from sin;

But to be free from dross

Still I would enter in.



Chorus:

Deeper, yet, deeper yet,

Into the crimson flood;

Deeper yet, deeper yet,

Under the precious blood.



# 2

Day by day, hour by hour

Blessings are sent to me;

But for more of His pow'r

Ever my pray'r shall be.  [Chorus]



# 3

Near to Christ I would live,

Following Him each day;

What I ask He will give,

So then with faith I pray.  [Chorus]



# 4

Now I have peace, sweet peace,

While in this world of sin;

But to pray I'll not cease

Till I am pure within.  [Chorus]
