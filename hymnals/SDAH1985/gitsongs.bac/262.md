# 1

There’s a sweet, sweet spirit in this place,

And I know that it’s the spirit of the Lord;

Sweet Holy Spirit,

Sweet Heavenly Dove,



# 2

Stay right here with us,

Filling us with Your love,

And for these blessings

We lift our hearts in praise,

Without a doubt we’ll know

That we have been revived

When we shall leave this place.



# 3

There are sweet expressions on each face,

And I know they feel the presence of the Lord.

Sweet Holy Spirit,

Sweet Heavenly Dove,



# 4

Stay right here with us,

Filling us with Your love,

And for these blessings

We lift our hearts in praise,

Without a doubt we’ll know

That we have been revived

When we shall leave this place.
