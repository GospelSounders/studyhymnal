# 1

There is a fountain fill'd with blood,

Drawn from Immanuel's veins;

And sinners plung'd beneath that flood

Lose all their guilty stains.

Lose all their guilty stains,

Lose all their guilty stains,

And sinners plung'd beneath that flood

Lose all their guilty stains.



# 2

The dying thief rejoiced to see,

That fountain in his day;

And there may I, though vile as he,

Wash all my sins away.

Wash all my sins away,

Wash all my sins away,

And there may I, though vile as he,

Wash all my sins away.



# 3

Thou dying Lamb!  thy precious blood

Shall never lose its pow'r,

Till all the ransomed Church of God

Are saved to sin no more.

Are saved to sin no more,

Are saved to sin no more.

Till all the ransomed Church of God

Are saved to sin no more.



# 4

E'er since by faith I saw the stream

Thy flowing wounds supply,

Redeeming love has been my theme,

And shall be till I die.



# 5

Lord, I believe thou hast prepared,

Unworthy though I be,

For me a blood-bought, free reward

Eternal life for me.



# 6

There in a nobler, sweeter song,

I'll sing thy pow'r to save,

When this poor lisping, stam'ring tongue

Is ransom'd from the grave.
