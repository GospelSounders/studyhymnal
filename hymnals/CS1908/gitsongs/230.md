# 1

Not I but Christ, be honored, loved, exalted;

Not I, but Christ, be seen, be known, be heard;

Not I, but Christ, in ev'ry look and action,

Not I, but Christ, in ev'ry tho't and word.



# 2

Not I, but Christ, to gently soothe in sorrow,

Not I, but Christ, to wipe the falling tear;

Not I, but Christ, to lift the weary burden,

Not I, but Christ, to hush away all fear.



# 3

Christ, only Christ!  no idle words e'er falling,

Christ, only Christ; no needless bustling sound;

Christ, only Christ; no self-important bearing;

Christ, only Christ; no trace of "I" be found.



# 4

Not I, but Christ, my ev'ry need supplying,

Not I, but Christ, my strength and health to be:

Christ, only Christ, for body, soul, and spirit,

Christ, only Christ, here and eternally.
