# 1

Lord, her watch Thy Church is keeping;

When shall earth Thy rule obey?

When shall end the night of weeping?

When shall break the promised day?

See the whit'ning harvest languish,

Waiting still the lab'rers' toil;

Was it vain, Thy Son's deep anguish!

Shall the strong retain the spoil?



# 2

Tidings, sent for ev'ry creature,

Millions yet have never heard;

Can they hear without a preacher?

Lord Almighty, give the word;

Give the word; in ev'ry nation

Let the gospel trumpet sound,

Witnessing of Thy salvation

To the earth's remotest bound.



# 3

Then the end:  Thy Church completed,

All Thy chosen gathered in,

With their King in glory seated,

Satan bound, and banished sin;

Gone forever, parting, weeping,

Hunger, sorrow, death, and pain;

Lo!  her watch Thy church is keeping,

Come, Lord Jesus; come to reign.
