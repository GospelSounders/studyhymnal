# 1

God is love; His mercy brightens

All the path in which we rove;

Bliss He wakes, and woe He lightens:

God is wisdom, God is love.



# 2

Chance and change are busy ever;

Man decays and ages move;

But His mercy waneth never:

God is wisdom, God is love.



# 3

E'en the hour that darkest seemeth

Will His changeless goodness prove;

From the gloom His brightness streameth:

God is wisdom, God is love.



# 4

He with earthly cares entwineth

Hope and comfort from above;

Everywhere His glory shineth;

God is wisdom, God is love.
