# 1

Immortal Love, forever full,

Forever flowing free,

Forever shared, forever whole,

A never ebbing sea!



# 2

We nay not climb the heavenly steeps

To bring the Lord Christ down;

In vain we search the lowest deeps,

For him no depths can drown.



# 3

But warm, so tender, even yet

A present help is He;

And faith has still its Olivet,

And love its Galilee.



# 4

The healing of His seamless dress

Is by our beds of pain;

We touch Him in life’s throng and press,

And we are whole again.



# 5

Through Him the first fond prayers are said,

Our lips of childhood frame;

The last low whispers of our dead

Are burdened with His name.



# 6

O Lord and Master of us all:

Whate’er our names or sign,

We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,

We test our lives by Thine!
