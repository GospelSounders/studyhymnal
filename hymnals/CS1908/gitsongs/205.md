# 1

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!

O, what a foretaste of glory divine!

Heir of salvation, purchase of God,

Born of his Spirit, wash'd in his blood.



Chorus:

This is my story, this is my song,

Praising my Saviour all the day long;

This is my story, this is my song,

Praising my Saviour all the day long.



# 2

Perfect submission, perfect delight,

Visions of rapture now burst on my sight.

Angels descending bring from above

Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.  [Chorus]



# 3

Perfect submission, all is at rest,

I in my Saviour am happy and blest,

Watching and waiting, looking above,

Filled with his goodness, lost in his love.  [Chorus]
