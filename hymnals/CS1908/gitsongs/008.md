# 1

Jesus is tenderly calling thee home

Calling today, calling today;

Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam

Farther and farther away?



Refrain:

Calling today,

calling today;

Jesus is calling,

is tenderly calling today.



# 2

Jesus is calling the weary to rest

Calling today, calling today;

Bring Him thy burden, and thou shalt be blest;

He will not turn thee away.  [Refrain]



# 3

Jesus is waiting, oh, come to Him now

Waiting today, waiting today;

Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow;

Come, and no longer delay.  [Refrain]



# 4

Jesus is pleading, oh, list to His voice

Hear Him today,

hear Him to-day;

They who believ on His name shall rejoice;

Quickly arise and away.  [Refrain]
