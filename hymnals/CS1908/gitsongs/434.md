# 1

One thot' I have, my ample creed,

So deep it is and broad;

And equal to my ev'ry need,

It is the tho't of God.



# 2

Each morn unfolds some fresh surprise,

I feast at life's full board;

And rising in my inner skies,

Shines forth the tho't of God.



# 3

At night my gladness is my pray'r;

I drop my daily load,

And ev'ry care is pillowed there

Upon the tho't of God.



# 4

I ask not far before to see,

But take in trust my road;

Life, death, and immortality

Are in my tho't of God
