# 1

I lay my sins on Jesus,

The spotless Lamb of God;

He bears them all, and frees us

From the accursed load,

From the accursed load.



# 2

I bring my guilt to Jesus,

To wash my crimson stains

White in His blood most precious

Till not a stain remains,

Till not a stain remains.



# 3

I lay my wants on Jesus,

All fullness dwells in Him;

He healeth my diseases

He doth my soul redeem,

He doth my soul redeem



# 4

I long to be with Jesus,

Meek, loving, lowly, mild;

I long to be like Jesus

The Father’s holy child,

The Father’s holy child.



# 5

I long to be with Jesus

Amid the heav’nly throng,

To sing with them His praises,

And learn the angels’ song.

And learn the angels’ song.
