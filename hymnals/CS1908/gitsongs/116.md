# 1

The sprinkled blood is speaking

Before the Father's throne,

The Spirit's pow'r is seeking

To make its virtues known;

The sprinkled blood is telling

Jehovah's love to man,

While heav'nly harps are swelling,

Sweet notes to mercy's plan.



# 2

The sprinkled blood is speaking

Forgiveness full and free,

Its wondrous pow'r is breaking

Each bond of guilt for me;

The sprinkled blood's revealing

A Father's smiling face,

The Saviour's love is sealing

Each monument of grace.



# 3

The sprinkled blood as pleading 

Its virtue as my own,

And there my soul is reading

Her title to Thy throne.

The sprinkled blood as owning

The weak one's feeblest plea;

'Mid sighs, and tears, and groaning,

It pleads, O Lord, with thee.



# 4

O wondrous pow'r, that seeketh

From sin to set me free!

O precious blood, that speaketh!

Should I not value thee?

The sprinkled blood is shedding

Its fragrance all around,

It gilds the path we're treading,

It makes our joys abound.
