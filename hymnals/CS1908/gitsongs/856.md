1.

We shall reach the summer land,

Some sweet day, by and by;

We shall press the golden strand,

Some sweet day, by and by;

O the loving welcome there,

By the tree of life so fair!

How we long that joy to share,

Some sweet day, by and by.



Refrain:

By and by,

Some sweet day,

We shall meet our lov'd ones gone,

Some sweet day, by and by.



2.

At the crystal river's brink,

Some sweet day, by and by;

We shall find each broken link,

Some sweet day, by and by;

Then the star that, fading here,

Left our hearts and homes so drear,

We shall see more bright and clear,

Some sweet day, by and by.  [Refrain]



3.

Oh, these parting scenes will end,

Some sweet day, by and by;

We shall gather friend with friend,

Some sweet day, by and by;

There before our Father's throne,

When the mists and clouds have flown,

We shall know as we are known,

Some sweet day, by and by.  [Refrain]
