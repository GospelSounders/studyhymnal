# 1

O day of rest and gladness,

O day of joy and light,

O balm of care and sadness,

Most beautiful, most bright;

On thee, the high and lowly,

Who bend before the throne,

Sing, Holy, holy, holy,

To the Eternal One.



# 2

Thou art a port protected

From storms that round us rise,

A garden intersected

With streams of paradise;

Thou art a cooling fountain

In life's dry, dreary sand;

From thee, like Pisgah's mountain,

We view our promised land.



# 3

A day of sweet reflection

Thou art, a day of love;

A day to raise affection

From earth to things above.

New graces ever gaining

From this our day of rest,

We seek the rest remaining

In mansions of the blest.
