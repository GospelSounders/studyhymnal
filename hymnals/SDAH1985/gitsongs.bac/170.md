# 1

Come, you faithful, raise the strain

Of triumphant gladness;

God has brought His Israel

Into joy from sadness;

Loosed from Pharoah’s bitter yoke

Jacob’s sons and daughters;

Led them with unmoistened foot

Through the Red Sea waters.



# 2

‘Tis the spring of souls today;

Christ has burst His prison,

And from three days’sleep in death

As a sun has risen;

All the winter of our sins,

Long and dark, is flying

From His light, to whom is giv’n

Laud and praise undying.



# 3

Now the queen of seasons, bright

With the day of splendor,

With the royal feast of feasts,

Comes its joy to render;

Comes to gladden faithful hearts

Which with true affection

Welcome in unwearied strain

Jesus’resurrection.



# 4

For today among the twelve

Christ appeared, be stowing

His deep peace, which evermore

Passes human knowing.

Neither could the gates of death,

Nor the tomb’s dark portal,

Nor the watchers, nor the seal,

Hold Him as a mortal.



# 5

“Alleluia!” now we cry

To our King immortal,

Who, triumphant, burst the bars

Of the tomb’s dark portal;

“Alleluia” with the Son,

God the Father praising;

“Alleluia!” yet again

To the Spirit raising.
