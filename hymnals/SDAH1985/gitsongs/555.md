# 1

Shepherd of tender you,

Guiding in love and truth,

Through devious way;

Christ our triumphant King,

We come Thy name to sin,

Hither our children bring

To shout Thy praise.



# 2

Thou are our holy Lord,

Thee all subduing Word,

Healer of strife;

Thou didst Thyself abase,

That from sin’s deep disgrace

Thou mightest save our race,

And give us life.



# 3

Thou are the great High Priest;

Thou has prepared the feast

Of heavenly love;

While in our mortal pain

None call on Thee in vain;

Help Thou does not disdain,

Help from above.



# 4

Ever be Thou our Guide,

Our Shepherd and our pride,

Our staff and song;

Jesus, Thou Christ of God,

By Thy perennial word,

Lead us where Thou hast trod,

Make our faith strong.
