1.

There is a land of pure delight,

Where saints immortal reign;

Infinite day excludes the night,

And pleasures banish pain.

There everlasting spring abides,

And never with'ring flow'rs,

And but a little space divides

This heav'nly land from ours.



2.

Pure is the land the saints espy,

And all the region peace;

No wanton lips nor envious eye

Can see or taste the bliss.

Those holy gates forever bar

Pollution, sin, and shame;

None shall obtain admittance there

But foll'wers of the Lamb.



3.

O could we make our doubts remove

Those gloomy doubts that rise,

And see the Canaan that we love,

With unbeclouded eyes;

Could we but climb where Moses stood,

And view the landscape o'er,

Not all this world's pretended good

Could ever charm us more.
