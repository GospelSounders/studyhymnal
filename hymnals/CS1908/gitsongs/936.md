1.

Christ is coming!  let creation

Bid her groans and travails cease;

Let the glorious proclamation

Hope restore and faith increase;

Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!

Come, thou blessed Prince of Peace!



2.

Earth can now but tell the story

Of thy bitter cross and pain;

She shall soon behold thy glory,

When thou comest back to reign;

Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!

Let each heart repeat the strain.



3.

Long thy exiles have been pining,

Far from rest, and home, and thee;

But, in heav'nly vesture shining,

Soon they shall thy glory see;

Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!

Hast the joyous jubilee.



4.

With that "blessed hope" before us,

Let no harp remain unstrung;

Let the mighty advent chorus

Onward roll, from tongue to tongue;

Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!

Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
