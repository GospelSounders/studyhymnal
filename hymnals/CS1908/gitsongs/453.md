# 1

Sing of Jesus, sing forever,

Of the love that changes never;

Who or what from Him can sever

Those He makes His own?



# 2

With His precious blood He bought us;

When we knew Him not, He sought us,

And from all our wand'rings bro't us;

His the praise alone.



# 3

Thro' the desert drear He leads us,

With the bread of heav'n He feeds us,

And thro' all the journey speeds us

To His glorious throne.
