# 1

Lead them, my God, to Thee,

Lead them to Thee,

These children dear of mine,

Thou gavest me;

O, by Thy love divine,

Lead them, my God, to Thee;

Lead them, my God, to Thee,

Lead them to Thee.



# 2

When earth looks bright and fair,

Festive and gay,

Let no delusive snare,

Lure them astray;

But from temptations' pow'r,

Lead them, my God, to Thee;

Lead them, my God, to Thee, 

Lead them to Thee.



# 3

E'en for such little ones,

Christ came a child,

And in this world of sin

Lived undefiled.

O, for His sake, I pray,

Lead them, my God, to Thee;

Lead them, my God, to Thee, 

Lead them to Thee.



# 4

Yea, tho' my faith be dim,

I would believe

That Thou this precious gift

Wilt now receive;

O, take their young hearts now,

Lead them, my God, to Thee;

Lead them, my God, to Thee,

Lead them to Thee.
