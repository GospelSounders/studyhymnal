# 1

In the land of fadeless day

Lies “the city four-square;”

It shall never pass away,

And there is “no night there.”



# Refrain

God shall “wipe away all tears;”

There’s no death, no pain, nor fears;

And they count not time by years,

For there is “no night there.”



# 2

All the gates of pearl are made,

In “the city four-square;”

All the streets with gold are laid,

And there is “no night there.”



# 3

And the gates shall never close

To “the city four-square;”

There life’s crystal river flows,

And there is “no night there.”



# 4

There they need no sunshine bright,

In “that city four-square;”

For the Lamb is all the light,

And there is “no night there.”
