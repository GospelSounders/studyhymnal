1.

From every stormy wind that blows,

From ev'ry swelling tide of woes,

There is a calm, a sure retreat;

'Tis found above the mercy seat.



2.

There is a scene where spirits blend,

Where friend holds fellowship with friend;

Though sundered far, by faith they meet

Around one common mercy seat.



3.

Ah!  whither should we flee for aid,

When tempted, desolate, dismayed?

Or how the hosts of sin defeat,

Had suff'ring saints no mercy seat?
