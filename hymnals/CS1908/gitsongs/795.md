1.

Go, labor on; spend and be spent,

Thy joy to do the Father's will;

It is the way the Master went;

Should not the servant tread it still?



2.

Go, labor on; 'tis not for naught;

Thine earthly loss is heav'nly gain:

Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not:

The Master praises, what are men?



3.

Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice;

For toil comes rest; for exile, home;

Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,

The midnight peal:  "Behold, I come!"
