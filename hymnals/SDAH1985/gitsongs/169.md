# 1

Come, you faithful, raise the strain

Of triumphant gladness;

God has brought His people

Now rejoice, Jerusalem,

And with true affection

Welcome in unwearied strains

Jesus’resurrection.



# 2

‘Tis the spring of souls today;

Christ has burst His prison

From the frost and gloom of death

light and life have risen

All the winter of our sins,

Long and dark, is flying

From His ligth, to whom we give

Thanks and praise undying.



# 3

“Alleluia!” now we cry

to our King immortal,

Who, triumphant, burst the

bars of the tomb’s dark portal

“Alleluia!” with the Son,

God the Father praising;

“Alleluia!” yet again to

the Spirit raising.
