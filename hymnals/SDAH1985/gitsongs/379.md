# 1

We give this child to You,

Our precious gift of love.

Help us to lead each step aright

With guidance from above.



# 2

O bless each child of Yours,

And grant when they are grown,

They will have learned to love Your way,

And choose it for their own.



# 3

We give ourselves to You,

And may Your Spirit fill

Our hearts and home, that all we do

Be subject to Your will.
