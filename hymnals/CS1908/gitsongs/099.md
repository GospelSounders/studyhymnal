# 1

Refining fire, go thro' my heart,

Refining fire, go thro' my heart,

Refining fire, go thro' my heart,

Illuminate my soul.



Chorus No. 1:

I can, I will, I do believe,

I can, I will, I do believe,

I can, I will, I do believe,

That Jesus saves me now.



Chorus No. 2:

I'm kneeling at the mercy seat,

I'm kneeling at the mercy seat,

I'm kneeling at the mercy seat,

Where Jesus answers pray'r.



# 2

Scatter Thy life thro' ev'ry part,

Scatter Thy life, thro' ev'ry part,

Scatter Thy life, thro' ev'ry part,

And sanctify the whole.



# 3

Oh, that it now from heav'n might fall,

Oh, that it now from heav'n might fall,

Oh, that it now from heav'n might fall,

And all my sins consume.



# 4

Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call,

Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call,

Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call,

Spirit of burning, come.
