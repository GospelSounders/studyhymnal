# 1

Just when I need Him, Jesus is near,

Just when I falter, just when I fear;

Ready to help me, ready to cheer,

Just when I need Him most.

Just when I need Him most,

Just when I need Him most,

Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,

Just when I need Him most.



# 2

Just when I need Him, Jesus is true,

Never forsaking, all the way through,

Giving for burdens pleasures anew,

Just when I need Him most.

Just when I need Him most,

Just when I need Him most,

Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,

Just when I need Him most.



# 3

Just when I need Him, Jesus is strong,

Bearing my burdens all the day long;

For all my sorrow giving a song,

Just when I need Him most.

Just when I need Him most,

Just when I need Him most,

Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,

Just when I need Him most.



# 4

Just when I need Him, He is my all,

Answering when upon Him I call;

Tenderly watching lest I should fall,

Just when I need Him most.

Just when I need Him most,

Just when I need Him most,

Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,

Just when I need Him most.
