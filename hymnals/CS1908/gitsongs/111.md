# 1

Jesus, and shall it ever be,

A mortal man ashamed of thee?

Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise,

Whose glories shine through endless days?



# 2

Ashamed of Jesus!  sooner far

Let evening blush to own a star;

He sheds the beams of light divine

O'er this benighted soul of mine.



# 3

Ashamed of Jesus! just as soon

Let midnight be ashamed of noon;

'Twas midnight with my soul till he,

Bright Morning Star, bade darkness flee.



# 4

Ashamed of Jesus!  that dear Friend

On whom my hopes of heav'n depend!

No; when I blush, be this my shame,

That I no more revere his name.



# 5

Ashamed of Jesus!  yes, I may 

When I've no guilt to wash away;

No tear to wipe, no good to crave,

No fears to quell, no soul to save.



# 6

Till then, nor is my boasting vain,

Till then I boast a Saivour slain;

And O, may this my glory be,

That Christ is not ashamed of me!
