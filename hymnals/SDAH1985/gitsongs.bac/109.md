# 1

Marvelous grace of our loving Lord.

Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!

Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured

There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.



# Refrain

Grace, grace, God’s grace,

Grace that will pardon and cleanse within

Grace, grace, God’s grace,

Grace that is greater than all our sin!



# 2

Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold,

Threaten the soul with infinite loss;

Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold

Points to the Refuge, the mighty Cross.



# 3

Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,

Freely bestowed on all who believe!

You that are longing to see His face,

Will you this moment His grace receive?
