# 1

Christ is made the sure foundation,

Christ the head and cornerstone,

chosen of the Lord, and precious,

binding all the Church in one;

holy Zion’s help for ever,

and her confidence alone.



# 2

All that dedicated city,

dearly loved of God on high,

in exultant jubilation

pours perpetual melody;

God the One in Three adoring

in glad hymns eternally.



# 3

To this temple, where we call thee,

come, O Lord of Hosts, today;

with thy wonted loving-kindness

hear thy servants as they pray,

and thy fullest benediction

shed within its walls alway.



# 4

Here vouchsafe to all thy servants

what they ask of thee of gain;

what they gain from thee, for ever

with the blessèd to retain,

and hereafter in thy glory

evermore with thee to reign.



# 5

Laud and honor to the Father,

laud and honor to the Son,

laud and honor to the Spirit,

ever Three, and ever One,

con-substantial, co-eternal,

while unending ages run.
