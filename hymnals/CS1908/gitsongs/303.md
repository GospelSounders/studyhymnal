# 1

Have I need of aught, O Saviour!

Aught on earth but thee?

Have I any in the heavens,

Any one but thee?



Chorus:

Only thee, only thee,

O the wondrous love shown me!

Only thee, only thee,

None on earth but thee.



# 2

Tho' I have of friends so many,

Love, and gold, and health;

If I have not thee, my Saviour,

Hold I any wealth?  [Chorus]



# 3

Is there heart so kind and patient

With my failings all?

Or a voice so true and ready,

Answering my call?  [Chorus]



# 4

Not for worlds would I exchange it,

This sweet faith in thee!

Earthly treasures cannot equal

All thou art to me.  [Chorus]
