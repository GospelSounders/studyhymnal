# 1

Are you tenting on the lowlands

Of the fated, flow'ry plain?

Are you nearing life's high mountains,

As the night comes on again?  



Chorus:

Keep tenting toward the highlands,

Each evening nearer home,

Keep tenting toward the highlands,

Keep tenting nearer home.



# 2

Does fair Sodom in her glory

Beckon you with ease or gain?

Heed her awful judgment story;

Linger not, her joys are vain.  [Chorus]



# 3

To the mountains of salvation!

Hear the angel, Mercy, call;

Do not tarry!  look not backward!

Hasten on ere vengeance fall.  [Chorus]
