# 1

God moves in a mysterious way

His wonders to perform;

He plants His footsteps in the sea,

And rides upon the storm.



# 2

Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;

The clouds ye so much dread

Are big with mercy, and shall break

In blessings on your head.



# 3

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,

But trust Him for His grace;

Behind a frowning providence

He hides a smiling face.



# 4

His purposes will ripen fast,

Unfolding every hour;

The bud may have a bitter taste,

But sweet will be the flower.



# 5

Blind unbelief is sure to err,

And scan His work in vain;

God is His own interpreter,

And He will make it plain.
