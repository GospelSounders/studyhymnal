# 1

Why do we waste on trifling cares

That life which God's compassion spares,

While in the various range of thought,

The one thing needful is forgot?



# 2

Shall God invite us from above? 

Shall Jesus urge his dying love?

Shall troubled conscience give us pain?

And all these pleas unite in vain?



# 3

Not so our eyes will always view

Those objects which we now pursue;

Not so will heav'n and hell appear,

When death's decisive hour is near.



# 4

Almighty God, thy grace impart;

Fix deep conviction on each heart;

Nor let us waste on trifling cares

That life in which thy compassion spares.
