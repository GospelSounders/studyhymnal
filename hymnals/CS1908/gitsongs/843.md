1.

O land of rest, for thee I sigh;

When will the moment come

When I shall lay my armor by, 

And dwell with Christ at home?



Chorus:

We'll work till Jesus comes,

We'll work till Jesus comes,

We'll work till Jesus comes,

And we'll be gathered home.



2.

No tranquil joys on earth I know,

No peace, shelt'ring dome;

This world's a wilderness of woe,

This world is not my home.



3.

When by affliction sharply tried,

Faith tells of scenes to come,

Those endless joys prepared above,

And then I sigh for home.
