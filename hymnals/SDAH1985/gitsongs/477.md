# 1

Come, ye disconsolate, where’er ye languish.

come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel.

Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;

earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.



# 2

Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,

hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure!

Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,

“Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.”



# 3

Here see the bread of life; waters flowing

forth from the throne of God, pure from above.

Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing

earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove.
