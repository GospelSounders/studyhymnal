427 â€“ Praise Him


1
Praise, O praise our God and King!
Hymns of adoration sing;
For his mercies still endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

2
Praise him that he made the sun,
Day by day his course to run,
And the silver moon by night,
Shining with her gentle light.

3
Praise him for our harvest store;
He hath fill'd the garner floor;
And for richer Food than this,
Pledge of everlasting bliss.
