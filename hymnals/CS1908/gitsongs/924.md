1.

When God descends with men to dwell,

And all creation wakes anew,

What tongue can half the wonders tell?

What eye the dazzling glory view?

What eye the dazzling glory view?



2.

Celestial streams shall gently flow,

The wilderness shall joyful be,

Lilies on parched grounds shall grow,

And gladness spring on every tree;

And gladness spring on every tree;



3.

The high and low shall meet in love,

All pride shall die, and meekness reign,

When Christ descends from worlds above

To dwell with men on earth again.

To dwell with men on earth again.
