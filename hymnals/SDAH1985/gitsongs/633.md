# 1

Sing the wondrous love of Jesus;

Sing his mercy and his grace.

In the mansions bright and blessed

He’ll prepare for us a place.



# Refrain

When we all get to heaven,

What a day of rejoicing that will be!

When we all see Jesus,

We’ll sing and shout the victory!



# 2

While we walk the pilgrim pathway,

Clouds will overspread the sky;

But when traveling days are over,

Not a shadow, not a sigh.



# 3

Let us then be true and faithful,

Trusting, serving every day;

Just one glimpse of him in glory

Will the toils of life repay.



# 4

Onward to the prize before us!

Soon his beauty we’ll behold;

Soon the pearly gates will open;

We shall tread the streets of gold.
