# 1

From every stormy wind that blows, From every swelling tide of woes,

There is a calm, a sure retreat: ‘Tis found beneath the mercy seat.



# 2

There is a place where Jesus sheds The oil of gladness on our heads,

A place than all besides more sweet; It is the blood-bought mercy seat.



# 3

There is a scene where spirits blend, Where friend holds fellowship with friend;

Though sundered far, by faith they meet Around one common mercy seat.



# 4

There, there, on angel’s wings we soar, And earthly cares molest no more,

And heaven comes down our souls to greet, And glory crowns the mercy seat.



# 5

Ah! whither should we flee for aid, When tempted, desolate dismayed?

Or how the hosts of sin defeat, Had suffering saints no mercy seat?
