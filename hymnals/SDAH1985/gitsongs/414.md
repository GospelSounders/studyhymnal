# 1

Fruitful trees, the Spirit’s sowing,

May we ripen and increase,

Fruit to life eternal growing,

Rich in love and joy and peace.



# 2

Laden branches freely bearing

Gifts the Giver loves to bless;

Here is fruit that grows by sharing,

Patience, kindness, gentleness.



# 3

Rooted deep in Christ, our Master,

Christ, our pattern and our goal,

Teach us, as the years fly faster,

Goodness, faith, and self control.



# 4

Fruitful trees, the Spirit’s tending,

May we grow till harvests cease;

Till we taste, in life unending,

Heaven’s love and joy and peace.
