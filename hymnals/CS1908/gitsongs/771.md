1.

Zion, awake!  thy slumber break;

No longer in thy sins lie down;

His garment of salvation take,

His beauty and His strength put on.



2.

Shake off the dust that blinds thy sight,

And hides the promise from thine eyes;

Arise, and struggle into light;

Thy great Deliv'rer calls, Arise!



3.

Vessels of mercy, sons of grace,

Be purged from ev'ry sinful stain;

Be like your Lord, his word embrace,

Nor bear his hallow'd name in vain.
