Now the joyful bells a-ring,

All ye mountains of the Lord!

Lift our hearts like birds a-winging,

All ye mountains, praise the Lord!

Now our festal season bringing

Kinsmen all to bide and board,

Sets our cheery voices singing;

All ye mountains, praise the Lord!



# 2

Dear our home as dear none other;

Where the mountains praise the Lord!

Gladly here our care we smother;

Where the mountains praise the Lord!

Here we know that Christ our brother

Binds us all as by a cord:

He was born of Mary mother

Where the mountains praise the Lord!



# 3

Cold the year, new whiteness wearing,

All ye mountains, praise the Lord!

Peace, good will to us a-bearing,

All ye mountains, praise the Lord!

Now we all God’s goodness sharing

Break the bread and sheath the Sword:

Bright our hearths the signal flaring,

All ye mountains, praise the Lord!
