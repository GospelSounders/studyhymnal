# 1

Shall we gather at the river,

where bright angel feet have trod,

with its crystal tide forever

flowing by the throne of God?



# Refrain

Yes, we’ll gather at the river,

the beautiful, the beautiful river;

gather with the saints at the river

that flows by the throne of God.



# 2

On the margin of the river,

washing up its silver spray,

we will walk and worship ever,

all the happy golden day.



# 3

Ere we reach the shining river,

lay we every burden down;

grace our spirits will deliver,

and provide a robe and crown.



# 4

Soon we’ll reach the shining river,

soon our pilgrimage will cease;

soon our happy hearts will quiver

with the melody of peace.
