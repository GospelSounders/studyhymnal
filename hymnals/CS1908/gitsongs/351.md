# 1

Praise the Lord, His glories show,

Saints within His courts below,

Angels round His throne above,

All that see and share His love,

Earth to heav'n and heav'n to earth,

Tell His wonders, sing His worth;

Age to age, and shore to shore,

Praise Him, praise Him evermore.



# 2

Praise the Lord, His mercies trace;

Praise His providence and grace,

All that He for men hath done,

All He sends us thro' His Son.

Strings and voices, hands and hearts,

In the concert bear your parts;

All that breathe, your Lord adore, 

Praise Him, praise Him evermore.  Amen.
