1.

A thrilling cry--we hear the sound;

The faithful watchmen lift their voice;

From land to land the world around

It bids the saints rejoice;

Ye pilgrims, rise, break forth and sing

The glorious coming of your King;

The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,

"Prepare to meet your Lord."



2.

Blow, watchmen, blow the certain sound,

For dark and dangerous in the night;

And daring scoffers gather round

The evil servants smite.

Ye faithful ones, the strict watch keep.

With lamps well trimmed, and do not sleep

The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,

"Prepare to meet your Lord."



3.

In earth's dark hour God's word gives light,

Its rays dispel the thickening gloom;

The path to glory now is bright

The Bridegroom soon will come.

Then lift your voices, saints, and sing

Your sweetest strains to Zion's King

The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,

"Prepare to meet your Lord."
