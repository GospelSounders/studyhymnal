# 1

Long ago the children sang a song

Of praise to Jesus as he rode along:

"Hosanna!  Hosanna!  

Hosanna in the highest!"



Chorus:

Happy songs, happy songs,

Let the children sing their happy, happy songs;

Happy songs, happy songs,

Jesus loves to hear our songs.



# 2

As of old he loves to hear us sing

Our songs of praise to him, our heav'nly King:

"Hosanna!  Hosanna!  

Hosanna in the highest!'  [Chorus]



# 3

By and by we'll sing a sweeter song

With all the saved, a glad and glorious throng:

"Hosanna!  Hosanna!

Hosanna in the highest!"  [Chorus]
