# 1

Day is dying in the west;

Heaven is touching earth with rest;

Wait and worship while the night

Sets the evening lamps alight

Through all the sky.



# Refrain

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!

Heaven and earth are full of Thee!

Heaven and earth are praising Thee,

O Lord most high!



# 2

Lord of life, beneath the dome

Of the universe, Thy home,

Gather us who seek Thy face

To the fold of Thy embrace,

For Thou art nigh.



# 3

While the deepening shadows fall,

Heart of love enfolding all,

Through the glory and the grace

Of the stars that veil Thy face,

Our hearts ascend.



# 4

When forever from our sight

Pass the stars, the day, the night,

Lord of angels, on our eyes

Let eternal morning rise

And shadows end.
