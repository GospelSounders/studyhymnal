## Study Hymnal
This is a comprehensive resource of all (or almost all) the hymnals ever used by advent believers since the movement begun during the great religious awakening of the early 19th century. It is intended to be an indiscriminate resource for everyone.  To the Bible Student (student of church history) it will surely provide a rich source of information about some of the doctrinal development that have taken place in the church. To the choir director or chorister it will provide much beautiful, useful, unobjectional music that will need a whole lifetime to learn, teach and sing. It is also intended to provide organized data useful for the publisher, printer or programmer. Our prayer is that this resource, not found anywhere else today, may have its contribution to the christian growth of the faithful in Christ Jesus.
