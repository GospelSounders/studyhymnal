# 1

Valley lilies, meek and lowly,

Let me hear your message sweet,

Tell of Christ the pure and holy,

Bending as to touch His feet.



Refrain:

Snowy lilies of the valley,

Speak again your message rare;

Testify to me of Jesus,

Heaven's Lily, wondrous fair!



# 2

Valley lilies, golden hearted,

Love's sweet mission you fulfill,

For you tell in perfumed language,

How he wrought his Father's will.  [Refrain]



# 3

Valley lilies, cups inverted,

Still the Master you proclaim:

Empty of all pomp and glory,

To redeem the world He came.  [Refrain]
