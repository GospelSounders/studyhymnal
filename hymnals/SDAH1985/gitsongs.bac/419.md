# 1

Soon shall the trump of God

Give out the welcome sound,

That shakes death’s silent chamber walls,

And breaks the turf sealed ground.



# 2

You dwellers in the dust,

Awake, come forth, and sing;

Sharp has your frost of winter been,

But bright shall be your spring.



# 3

‘Twas sown in weakness here;

‘Twill then be raised in power;

That which was sown in earthly seed

Shall rise a heav’nly flower.
