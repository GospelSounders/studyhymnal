# 1

How cheering is the Christian's hope,

While toiling here below!

It buoys us up while passing thro'

This wilderness of woe,



# 2

It points to us a land of rest,

Where saints with Christ will reign,

Where we shall meet the loved of earth,

And never part again,



# 3

A land where sin can never come,

Temptations ne'er annoy,

Where happiness will ever dwell,

And that without alloy.



# 4

In that bright world no fears will flow,

Death ne'er can enter there;

For all who gain that heavenly land

Will be as angels are.



# 5

Fly, ling'ring moments, fly, O fly,

Dear Saviour, quickly come!

We long to see thee as thou art,

And reach that blissful home.
