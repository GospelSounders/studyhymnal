# 1

In Christ there is no east nor west,

In Him no south or north;

But one great fellowship of love

Throughout the whole wide earth.



# 2

In Him shall true heart everywhere

Their high communion find;

His service is the golden cord

Close binding all mankind.



# 3

Join hands, then, brothers of the faith,

Whate’er your race may be.

Who serves my Father as a son

Is surely kin to me.



# 4

In Christ now meet both east and west,

In Him meet south and north;

All Christly souls are one in Him

Throughout the whole wide earth.
