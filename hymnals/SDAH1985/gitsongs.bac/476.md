# 1

Days are filled with sorrow and care,

Hearts are lonely and drear;

Burdens are lifted at Calvary,

Jesus is very near.



# Refrain

Burdens are lifted at Calvary,

Calvary, Calvary,

Burdens are lifted at Calvary,

Jesus is very near.



# 2

Cast your care on Jesus today,

Leave your worry and fear;

Burdens are lifted at Calvary,

Jesus is very near.



# 3

Troubled soul, the Saviour can see,

Ev’ry heartache and tear;

Burdens are lifted at Calvary

Jesus is very near.
