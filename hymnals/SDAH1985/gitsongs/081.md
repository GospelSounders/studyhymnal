# 1

Though I speak with tongues of men and angels,

Though I have the prophet’s gift,

Though I hold the keys to hidden knowledge,

Though my faith can mountains shift;

Without love I am no better,

Without love it’s all for naught;

Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:

What this means I would be taught.



# 2

Love is patient, knows no envy,

Never gloats when others sin;

Love is never glad to see injustice,

Always wants the truth to win.

There’s no end to love’s endurance,

There’s no test it cannot face;

Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:

I shall fail without Your grace.



# 3

Though there’ll be an end to hidden knowledge,

Visions, raptures, prophecy:

Faith and hope and love shall last forever,

Love the greatest of the three.

Without love I am no better,

Without love it’s all for naught;

Lord, You gave Your life in saving others:

What this means I would be taught.
