# 1

We are living, we are dwelling,

In a grand and awful time,

In an age on ages telling,

To be living is sublime.

Hark!  the waking up of nations,

Gog and Magog to the fray;

Hark!  what soundeth?  Is creation

Groaning for her latter day?



# 2

Christian, rouse and arm for conflict,

Nerve thee for the battle field;

Bear the helmet of salvation,

And the mighty gospel shield;

Bind the breastplate firmly on thee,

Take the Spirit's sword in hand;

Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then,

In Jehovah's strength to stand.



# 3

Wicked spirits gather round thee,

Legions of those foes to God--

Principalities most mighty--

Walk unseen the earth abroad;

They are gath'ring to the battle,

Strengthen'd for the last deep strife;

Christian, arm!  be watchful, ready,

Struggle manfully for life.
