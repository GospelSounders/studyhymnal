1.

Amazing grace!  how sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost, but now am found;

Was blind, but now I see.



2.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,

And grace my fears relieved;

How precious did that grace appear,

The hour I first believed!



3.

Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares,

I have already come;

'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,

And grace will lead me home.
