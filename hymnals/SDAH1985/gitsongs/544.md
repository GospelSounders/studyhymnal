# 1

Jesus, Son of blessed Mary,

Once on earth a little child,

Pattern fair of holy living,

Gracious, loving, undefiled;



# 2

Though Thy eager heart was yearning

Heavy laden souls to free,

Yet Thou calledst little children

In their happiness to Thee.



# 3

Grant that we, like little children,

Free from pride and guile my be;

Cheerful, trusting, safe, protected

By the blessed Trinity.
