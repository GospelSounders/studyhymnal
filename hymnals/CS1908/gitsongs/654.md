# 1

Rock of Ages, cleft for me!

Let me hide myself in thee;

Let the water and the blood,

From thy riven side that flowed,

Be of sin the double cure;

Save me from its guilt and pow'r.



# 2

Not the labor of my hands

Can fulfil thy law's demands;

Could my zeal no respite know,

Could my tears forever flow,

All for sin could not atone;

Thou must save, and thou alone.



# 3

Nothing in my hand I bring

Simply to thy cross I cling;

Naked, come to thee for dress,

Helpless, look to thee for grace;

Foul, I to the Fountain fly,

Wash me, Saviour, or I die.



# 4

While I draw this fleeting breath,

When mine eyes shall close in death,

When I soar to world's unknown,

See thee on thy Judgment throne,

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

Let me hide myself in thee.
