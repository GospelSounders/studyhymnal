451 â€“ Before Jehovah's Throne


1
Before Jehovah's awful throne,
Ye nations bow with sacred joy;
Know that the Lord is God alone;
He can create, and he destroy.

2
We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,
High as the heav'ns voices raise;
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.

3
Wide as the world is thy command,
Vast as eternity thy love;
Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,
When rolling years shall cease to move.
