# 1

Saviour, lead me lest I stray,

Gently lead me all the way;

I am safe when by thy side,

I would in thy love abide.

Lead me, Lead me, 

Saviour, lead me, lest I stray;

Gently down the stream of time,

Lead me, Saviour, all the way.



# 2

Thou the refuge of my soul,

When life's stormy billows roll;

I am safe when thou art nigh,

All my hopes on thee rely.

Lead me, Lead me, 

Saviour, lead me, lest I stray;

Gently down the stream of time,

Lead me, Saviour, all the way.



# 3

Saviour, lead me till at last,

When the storm of life is past,

I shall reach the land of day,

Where all tears are wiped away.

Lead me, Lead me, 

Saviour, lead me, lest I stray;

Gently down the stream of time,

Lead me, Saviour, all the way.
