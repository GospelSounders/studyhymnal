# 1

As it fell upon a night

In the winter weather,

Angels bright in starry height

Began to sing together.



# 2

Shepherds sleeping on the plain

Woke to see the glory,

All amazed they stood and gazed

And heard the angels’ story.



# 3

Unto you a child is born

In a manger lowly,

Humble, He, yet born to be

The King of Love most holy.



# 4

Happy angels from afar,

Cease your singing never!

In excelsis gloria!

Forever and forever.
