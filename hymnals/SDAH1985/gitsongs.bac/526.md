# 1

God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus,

He came to love, heal, and forgive;

He lived and died to buy my pardon,

An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.



# Refrain

Because He lives I can face tomorrow,

Because He lives all fear is gone;

Because I know He holds the future.

And life is worth the living just because He lives.



# 2

How sweet to hold a newborn baby,

And feel the pride, and joy He gives;

But greater still the calm assurance,

This child can face uncertain days because He lives.
