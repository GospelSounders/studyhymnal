# 1

Safely thro' another week

God has brought us on our way;

Let us now a blessing seek,

Waiting in his courts today,

Day of all the week the best,

Emblem of eternal rest,

Day of all the week the best,

Emblem of eternal rest.



# 2

While we seek supplies of grace

Thro' the dear Redeemer's name,

Show thy reconciling face,

Take away our sin and shame;

From our worldly cares set free

May we rest this day in thee,

From our worldly cares set free

May we rest this day in thee.



# 3

Here we come thy name to praise,

May we feel thy presence near,

May thy glory meet our eyes

While we in thy courts appear;

Here afford us, Lord, a taste

Of our everlasting feast,

Here afford us, Lord, a taste

Of our everlasting feast.



# 4

May the gospel's joyful sound

Conquer sinners, comfort saints;

Make the fruits of grace abound,

Bring relief to all complaints;

Thus may all our Sabbaths be

Till we rise to reign with thee,

Thus may all our Sabbaths be

Till we rise to reign with thee.
