# 1

As saints of old their first fruits brought

Of orchard, flock, and field

To God the giver all good,

The source of bounteous yield;

So we today first fruits would bring:

The wealth of this good land,

Of farm and market, shop and home,

Of mind, and heart, and hand.



# 2

A world in need now summons us

To labor, love, and give;

To make our life an offering

To God, that all may live.

The Church of Christ is calling us

To make the dream come true:

A world redeemed by Christ-like love;

All life in Christ made new.



# 3

In gratitude and humble trust

We bring our best today,

To serve Your cause and share Your love

With all along life’s way.

O God, who gave yourself to us

In Jesus Christ Your Son,

Teach us to give ourselves each day

Until life’s work is done.
