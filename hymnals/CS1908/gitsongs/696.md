# 1

Go forth on wings of faith and pray'r,

Ye pages bright with love;

Tho' mute, the joyful tidings bear,

Salvation from above.



Refrain:

Silent messengers, go ye forth,

From ocean to ocean, from South to North;

Seed of the word, it shall not be sown in vain.



# 2

Go, tell the sinful, careless soul,

The warning God has giv'n;

Go, make the wounded spirit whole,

With healing balm from heav'n.  [Refrain]



# 3

Go to the rude, the dark, the poor,

That live estranged from God;

Bid them the pearl of life secure,

Bo't with a Saviour's blood.  [Refrain]



# 4

O Jesus, friend of dying men,

Thy presence we implore;

Without thy blessing all is vain;

Be with us evermore.  [Refrain]
