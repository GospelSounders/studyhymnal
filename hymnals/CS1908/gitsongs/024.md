# 1

Sin it o'er and o'er again,

Glorious message, clear and plain;

'Tis today the same as then,

Christ receiveth sinful men.



Chorus:

Wonderful word, O sweet refrain!

Christ receives sinful men

Message of mercy, clear and plain,

Christ receiveth sinful men.



# 2

"Seek and find," and "look and live;" 

Grace is free!  proclaim to all

Who the heav'nly pathway leave,

All who linger, all who fall.  [Chorus]



# 3

Years of sin condemn us not,

Pure before the law we stand;

Jesus' blood removes each spot,

Satisfies its full demand.  [Chorus]



# 4

He will take the sinfulest,

Make the scarlet white and pure;

Come, and he will give you rest;

Trust his word, forever sure.  [Chorus]



# 5

In Thy righteous robe to shine,

Lord, I come, and rest forgiv'n;

Self is love in love divine,

Death in life, and earth in heav'n.  [Chorus]
