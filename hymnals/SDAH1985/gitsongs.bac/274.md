# 1

O Word of God incarnate,

O Wisdom from on high,

O Truth unchanged, unchanging,

O Light of our dark sky:

we praise you for the radiance

that from the hallowed page,

a lantern to our footsteps,

shines on from age to age.



# 2

The church from her dear Master

received the gift divine,

and still that light is lifted

o’er all the earth to shine.

It is the sacred vessel

where gems of truth are stored;

it is the heaven-drawn picture

of Christ, the living Word.



# 3

It floateth like a banner

before God’s host unfurled;

it is a shining beacon

above the darkling world.

It is the chart and compass

that o’er life’s surging tide,

mid mists and rocks and quicksands,

Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.



# 4

O make Thy church, dear Savior,

a lamp of purest gold,

to bear before the nations

your true light as of old.

O teach your wandering pilgrims

by this their path to trace,

till, clouds and darkness ended,

they see Thee face to face.
