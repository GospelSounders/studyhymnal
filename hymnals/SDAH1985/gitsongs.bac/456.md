# 1

I have a Friend so precious,

So very dear to me,

He loves me with such tender love,

He loves so faithfully;

I could not live apart form Him,

I love to feel Him nigh,

And so we dwell together,

My Lord and I.



# 2

Sometimes I’m faint and weary,

He knows that I am weak,

And as He bids me lean on Him,

His help I gladly seek;

He leads me in the paths of light,

Beneath a sunny sky,

And so we walk together,

My Lord and I.



# 3

I tell Him all my sorrows,

I tell Him all my joys,

I tell Him all that pleases me,

I tell Him what annoys;

He tells me what I ought to do,

He tells me how to try,

And so we talk together,

My Lord and I.



# 4

He knows that I am longing

Some weary soul to win,

And so He bids me go and speak

The loving word for Him;

He bids me tell His wondrous love,

And why He came to die,

And so we work together,

My Lord and I.
