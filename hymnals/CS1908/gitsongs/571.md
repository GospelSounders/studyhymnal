# 1

Master, hast thou work for me?

I would gladly toil for thee;

I have neither strength nor skill,

Yet some place I long to fill;



Refrain:

Tho' my hands are small and weak,

Yet some little task I seek.

Master, hast thou work for me?

I would gladly toil for thee.



# 2

Let me learn in early youth,

Lessons from thy Book of truth;

Let me seek to walk thy ways,

Know thy will and sing thy praise;  



Refrain: 

Heart and hands to thee I bring,

Let me serve thee, holy King!

Master, hast thou work for me?  

I would gladly toil for thee.



# 3

Let me daily sow some seed,

Daily do some kindly deed;

Grant thy loving help to me,

Give me perfect trust in thee;



Refrain:

Trusting thee to teach me how,

Let me serve thee, here and now.

Master, hast thou work for me?

I would gladly toil for thee.
