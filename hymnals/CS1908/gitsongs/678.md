# 1

Faith of our fathers!  living still

In spite of dungeon, fire, and sword:

O how our hearts beat high with joy

Whene'er we hear that glorious word:

Faith of our fathers!  holy faith!

We will be true to thee till death!



# 2

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,

Were still in heart and conscience free:

How sweet would be their children's fate,

If they, like them, could die for thee!

Faith of our fathers!  holy faith!

We will be true to thee till death!



# 3

Faith of our fathers!  we will love

Both friend and foe in all our strife;

And preach thee, too, as love knows how,

By kindly words and virtuous life.

Faith of our fathers!  holy faith!

We will be true to thee till death!
