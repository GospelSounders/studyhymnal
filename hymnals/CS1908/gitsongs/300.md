# 1

Down at the cross where my Saviour died,

Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,

There to my heart was the blood applied.

Glory to his name.



Chorus:

Glory to his name,

Glory to his name.

There to my heart was the blood applied,

Glory to his name.



# 2

I am so wondrously saved from sin,

Jesus so sweetly abides within,

There at the cross where he took me in,

Glory to his name.  [Chorus]



# 3

O precious Fountain that saves from sin!

I am so glad I have entered in,

There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean.

Glory to his name.  [Chorus]



# 4

Come to this Fountain so rich and sweet,

Cast thy poor soul at the Saviour's feet,

Plunge in today and be made complete, 

Glory to his name.  [Chorus]
