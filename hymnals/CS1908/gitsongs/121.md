# 1

Weary of earth and laden with my sin,

I look to heav'n and long to enter in;

But there no evil thing may find a home:

And yet I hear a voice that bids me "Come."



# 2

The while I fain would tread the heav'nly way,

Evil is ever with me day by day;

Yet on mine ears the gracious tidings fall,

"Repent, return, thou shalt be loos'd from all."



# 3

Cease, restless will!  thy lonely strife resign!

I know too well how little strength is mine;

Grant me, dear Lord, thy saving love to see:

I strive no more, I give myself to thee.
