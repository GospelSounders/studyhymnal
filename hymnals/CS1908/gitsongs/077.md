077 – Like as a Father


1
Like as a father, pities his child,
So the Lord pities the sinner defiled;
Waiteth in kindness,
Pities our blindness,
Longeth to welcome, tho' often reviled.

2
Like as a father when we believe,
Merciful Saviour, He waits to receive;
Listens to hear us,
Blesses to cheer us,
Pities whenever His Spirit we grieve.

3
Like as a father, ever the same,
He that created, and knoweth our frame;
Watcheth the straying,
Guardeth the praying,
Bids us to trust in His Almighty name.

4
Like as a father, constant is He,
God is our passion regardeth our plea;
In need He cometh, 
Precious His promise;
Father in heaven for ever to be.
