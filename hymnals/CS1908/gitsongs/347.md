# 1

Fresh from the throne of glory,

Bright in its crystal gleam,

Bursts out the living Fountain,

Swells on the living Stream.



Refrain:

Holy River, I would ever

Draw my life from thee;

Mighty River, I will never

Cease to sing of thee.



# 2

Stream full of life and gladness,

Spring of all health and peace,

No harps by thee hang silent,

Nor happy voices cease.  [Refrain]



# 3

River of God, I greet thee,

Now not afar, but near;

My soul to thy still waters

Hastes in its thirstings here.  [Refrain]



# 4

Jesus, the healing Fountain,

Fresh from the throne above,

Thou art the living water,

Thou art the stream of love.  [Refrain]
