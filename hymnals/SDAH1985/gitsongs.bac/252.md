# 1

Come, let us sing the song of songs-

The angels first began the strain-

The homage which to Christ belongs:

“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”



# 2

Slain to redeem us by His blood,

To cleanse from every sinful stain,

And make us kings and priests to God:

“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”



# 3

To Him who suffered on the tree,

Our souls, at His soul’s price, to gain,

Blessing, and praise, and glory be:

“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”



# 4

To Him, enthroned by filial right

All power in heaven and earth proclaim,

Honor, and majesty, and might:

“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”



# 5

Long as we live, and when we die,

And while in heaven with Him we reign,

This song our song of songs shall be:

“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”
