# 1

The King of love my Shepherd is,

Whose goodness faileth never;

I nothing lack if I am His,

And He is mine forever.



# 2

Where streams of living water flow

My ransomed soul He leadeth,

And where the verdant pastures grow,

With food celestial feedeth.



# 3

Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,

But yet in love He sought me,

And on His shoulder gently laid,

and home, rejoicing, brought me.



# 4

And so thro' all the length of days

Thy goodness faileth never

Good Shepherd!  I would sing Thy praise

Within Thy house forever.
