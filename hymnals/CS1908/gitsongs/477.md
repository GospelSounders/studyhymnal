477 â€“ Working, O Christ, With Thee


1
Working, O Christ, with thee,
Working with thee,
Unworthy, sinful, weak, 
Tho' we may be;
Our all to thee we give,
For thee alone we live,
And by thy grace achieve,
Working with thee.

2
Along the city's waste,
Working with thee,
Our eager footsteps haste,
Like thee to be;
The poor we gather in,
The outcasts raise from sin,
And labor souls to win,
Working with thee.

3
Saviour, we weary not,
Working with thee,
As hard as thine our lot
Can never be;
Our joy and comfort this,
"Thy grace sufficient is;"
This changes toil to bliss,
Working with thee.

4
So let us labor on,
Working with thee,
Till earth to thee is won,
From sin set free;
Till men, from shore to shore,
Receive thee, and adore,
And join us evermore,
Working with thee.
