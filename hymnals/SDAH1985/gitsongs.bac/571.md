# 1

What does the Lord require for praise and offering?

What sacrifice, desire or tribute bid you bring?

Do justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.



# 2

Rulers of men, give ear! Should you not justice show?

Will God your pleading hear, while crime and cruelty grow?

Do justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.



# 3

How shall our life fulfill God’s law so hard and high?

Let Christ endue our will with grace to fortify.

Then justly, in mercy we’ll humbly walk with God.
