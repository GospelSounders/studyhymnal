# 1

When the cross seems hard to carry,

Lift!  brother, lift!

O'er the burden never tarry,

Lift!  brother, lift!



Chorus:

Lift the cross and clasp it tighter,

Lift!  brother, lift!

Lifting makes the burden lighter,

Lift!  brother, lift!



# 2

Duty's call is self-denying,

Lift!  brother, lift!

Half the battle lies in trying,

Lift!  brother, lift!  [Chorus]



# 3

When the evil seems the strongest,

Lift!  brother, lift!

Lift the hardest, lift the longest,

Lift!  brother, lift!  [Chorus]
