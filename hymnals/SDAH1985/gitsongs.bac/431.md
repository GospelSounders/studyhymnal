# 1

Come let us sing of homeland,

Down by the crystal sea;

Wonderful land where Jesus

Buildeth a mansion for me.



# Refrain

Over yonder, down by the crystal sea,

down              by the crystal sea,

Over yonder, there’s where I long to be,

There’s            where I long to be,

No more sorrow, toil, grief, nor care,

In the homeland bright and fair,

Over, over there.

Over there.



# 2

Water of life there floweth,

Fruit in abundant store;

Citizens of that country

Hunger and thirst never more.



# 3

Come go with me to homeland,

Jesus invites you there;

Help spread the invitation,

Tell it to men everywhere.
