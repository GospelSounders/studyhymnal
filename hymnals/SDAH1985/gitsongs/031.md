# 1

Tell out my soul, the greatness of the Lord:

Unnumbered blessings, give my spirit voice;

Tender to me the promise of His Word;

In God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice.



# 2

Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His name:

Make known His might, the deeds His arm has done;

His mercy sure, from age to age the same;

His holy name, the Lord, the Mighty One.



# 3

Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might:

Pow’rs and dominions lay their glory by;

Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,

The hungry fed, the humble lifted high.



# 4

Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word:

Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure.

Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord

To children’s children and forevermore.
