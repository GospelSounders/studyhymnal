# 1

Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;

I want thee forever, to live in my soul;

Break down ev'ry idol, cast out ev'ry foe;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.



Chorus:

Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.



# 2

Lord Jesus, look down from thy throne in the skies,

And help me to make a complete sacrifice;

I give up myself, and whatever I know;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]



# 3

Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;

I wait, blessed Lord, at thy crucified feet,

By faith,for my cleansing, I see thy blood flow; 

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]



# 4

Lord Jesus, thou seest I patiently wait;

Come now, and within me a new heart create;

To those who have sought thee, then never said'st No;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]
