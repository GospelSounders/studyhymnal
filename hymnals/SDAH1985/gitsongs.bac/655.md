# 1

Happy the home when God is there,

and love fills every breast;

when one their wish, and one their prayer,

and one their heavenly rest.



# 2

Happy the home where Jesus’ name

is sweet to every ear;

where children early speak his fame,

and parents hold him dear.



# 3

Happy the home where prayer is heard,

and praise is wont to rise;

where parents love the sacred Word

and all its wisdom prize.



# 4

Lord, let us in our homes agree

this blessed peace to gain;

unite our hearts in love to thee,

and love to all will reign.
