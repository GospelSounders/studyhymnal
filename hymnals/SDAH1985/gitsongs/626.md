# 1

Let us sing a song that will cheer us by the way,

In a little while we’re going home.

For the night will end in the everlasting day,

In a little while we’re going home.



# Refrain

In a little while, In a little while,

We shall cross the billow’s foam;

We shall meet at last, When the stormy winds are past,

In a little while we’re going home.



# 2

We will do the work that our hands may find to do,

In a little while we’re going home.

And the grace of God will our daily strength renew,

In a little while we’re going home.



# 3

We will smooth the path for some weary, wayworn feet,

In a little while we’re going home.

And may loving hearts spread around an influence sweet!

In a little while we’re going home.



# 4

There’s a rest beyond, there’s relief from every care,

In a little while we’re going home;

And no tears shall fall in that city bright and fair,

In a little while we’re going home.
