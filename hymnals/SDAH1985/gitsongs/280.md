# 1

Come, ye sinners poor and needy,

Weak and wounded, sick and sore;

Jesus ready stands to save you,

Full of pity, love, and power.



# Refrain

I will arise and go to Jesus,

He will embrace me in His arms;

In the arms of my dear Savior,

O there are ten thousand charms.



# 2

Come. ye thirsty, come, and welcome,

God’s free bounty glorify;

True belief and true repentance,

Every grace that brings you nigh.



# 3

Let not conscience make you linger,

Nor of fitness fondly dream;

All the fitness He requireth

Is to feel your need of Him.



# 4

Lo! th’incarnate God, ascended,

Pleads the merit of His blood;

Venture on Him, venture wholly,

Let no other trust intrude.
