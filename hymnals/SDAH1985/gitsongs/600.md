# 1

Sweet promise is given to all who believe–

“Behold I come quickly, Mine own to receive;

Hold fast till I come; the danger is great;

Sleep not as do others; be watchful, and wait.”



# Refrain

“Hold fast till I come,” sweet promise of heaven–

“The kingdom restored, to you shall be given.”

“Come, enter My joy, sit down on the throne;

Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come.”



# 2

We’ll “watch unto prayer” with lamps burning bright;

He comes to all others a “thief in the night.”

We know He is near, but know not the day–

As spring shows that summer is not far away.



# 3

Yes! this is our hope, ’tis built on His word–

The glorious appearing of Jesus, our Lord;

Of promises all, it stands as the sum:

“Behold I come quickly; hold fast till I come.”
