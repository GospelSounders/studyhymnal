# 1

Look for the way-marks as you journey on,

Look for the way-marks passing one by one;

Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four—

Where are we standing? Look the way-marks o’er.



# Refrain

Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,

Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four.

Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic way-marks;

The journey’s almost o’er.



# 2

First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,

Then Medo-Persia’s banners were unfurled;

And after Greece held universal sway,

Rome seized the scepter—where are we today?



# 3

Down in the feet of iron and of clay,

Weak and divided, soon to pass away;

What will the next great, glorious drama be?

Christ and His coming, and eternity.
