# 1

I lay my sins on Jesus,

The spotless Lamb of God;

He bears them all, and frees us

From the accursed load.

I bring my guilt to Jesus,

To watch the crimson stains

White in His blood most precious,

Till not one spot remains.



# 2

I lay my wants on Jesus;

All fullness dwells in Him;

He heals all my diseases,

He doth my soul redeem:

I lay my griefs on Jesus,

My burdens and my cares,

He from them all releases,

He all my sorrow shares.



# 3

I long to be like Jesus,

Meek, loving, lowly, mild;

I long to be like Jesus,

The Father's holy child:

I long to be with Jesus

Amid the heav'nly throng,

To sing with them His praises,

To learn the angel's song.
