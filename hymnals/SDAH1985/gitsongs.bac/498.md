# 1

Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,

When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;

Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,

Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.



# 2

Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows,

The solemn hush of nature newly born;

Alone with Thee in breathless adoration,

In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.



# 3

Still, still with Thee! As to each newborn morning

A fresh and solemn splendor still is given,

So does this blessed consciousness, awaking,

Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.



# 4

So shall it be at last, in that bright morning,

When the soul waketh and life’s shadows flee;

O in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,

Shall rise the glorious thought, I am with Thee.
