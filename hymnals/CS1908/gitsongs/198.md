# 1

There's sunshine in my soul to-day,

More glorious and bright

Than glows in any earthly sky,

For Jesus is my light.



Chorus:

O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,

When the peaceful, happy moments roll;

When Jesus shows his smiling face

There is sunshine in the soul.



# 2

There's music in my soul to-day,

A carol to my King,

And Jesus listening, can hear

The songs I cannot sing.  [Chorus]



# 3

There's springtime in my soul to-day,

For when the Lord is near,

The dove of peace sings in my heart,

The flow'rs of grace appear.  [Chorus]



# 4

There's gladness in my soul to-day,

And hope, and praise, and love,

For blessings which he gives me now,

For joys laid up above.  [Chorus]
