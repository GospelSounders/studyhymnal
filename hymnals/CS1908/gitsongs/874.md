1.

Sorrow and care may meet,

The tempest cloud may low'r,

The surge of sin may beat

Upon earth's troubled shore;



Refrain:

God doth his own in safety keep;

He giveth his beloved sleep,

He giveth his beloved sleep.



2.

The din of war may roll

With all its raging flight;

Grief may oppress the soul

Thro'out the weary night; [Refrain]



3.

In childhood's winsome page,

In manhood's joyous bloom,

In feebleness and age,

In death's dark, gath'ring gloom; [Refrain]
