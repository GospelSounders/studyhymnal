# 1

Look upon Jesus, sinless is He;

Father, impute His life unto me.

My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,

Cover with His life, whiter than snow.



# Refrain

Cover with His life, whiter than snow;

Fullness of His life then shall I know;

My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,

Cover with His life, whither than snow.



# 2

Deep are the wounds transgression has made;

Red are the stains; my soul is afraid.

O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee,

Safe from the law that now judgeth me!



# 3

Longing the joy of pardon to know;

Jesus holds out a robe white as snow;

“Lord, I accept it! Leaving my own,

Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone.”



# 4

Reconciled by His death for my sin,

Justified by His life pure and clean,

Sanctified by obeying His word,

Glorified when returneth my Lord.
