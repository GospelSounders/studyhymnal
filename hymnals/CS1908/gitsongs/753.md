1.

The tempter to my soul hath said, 

"There is no help in God for thee;"

Lord, lift thou up thy servant's head;

My glory, shield, and solace be.



2.

Thus to the Lord I raised my cry;

He heard me from his holy hill;

At his command the waves rolled by;

He beckoned, and the winds were still.



3.

I will not fear, tho' armed throngs

Compass my steps in all their wrath;

Salvation to the Lord belongs;

His presence guards his people's path.
