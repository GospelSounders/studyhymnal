# 1

Glorious things of thee are spoken,

Zion, city of our God;

He whose word cannot be broken

Formed thee for His own abode;

On the Rock of Ages founded,

What can shake thy sure repose?

With salvation’s wall surrounded,

Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.



# 2

See the streams of living waters

Springing from eternal love,

Well supply thy sons and daughters,

And all fear and want remove;

Who can faint when such a river

Ever flows their thirst to assuage?

Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,

Never fails from age to age.



# 3

Round each habitation hovering,

See the cloud and fire appear

For a glory and a covering,

Showing that the Lord is near;

Blest inhabitants of Zion,

Washed in the Redeemer’s blood;

Jesus, whom their souls rely on,

Makes them kings and priests to God.



# 4

Savior, if of Zion’s city

I, through grace, a member am,

Let the world deride or pity,

I will glory in Thy name;

Fading is the worldling’s pleasure,

All his boasted pomp and show;

Solid joys and lasting treasure

None but Zion’s children know.
