# 1

Jesus, my all to heav'n has gone,

He whom I fix my hopes upon;

His track I see, and I'll pursue

The narrow way till him I view.



Refrain:

I'll pursue him, I'll pursue him,

Yes, I'll pursue my Lord and King.



# 2

This is the way I long have sought,

And mourned because I found it not;

My brief a burden long has been,

Because I was not saved from sin.  [Refrain]



# 3

Now will I tell to all around,

What a dear Saviour I have found;

I'll point to thy redeeming blood,

And say, "Behold the way to God."  [Refrain]
