# 1

Come to the living waters, come!

Obey your Maker's call;

Return, ye weary wand'rers, home;

My grace is free for all,

My grace is free for all.



# 2

Nothing ye in exchange shall give;

Leave all you have behind;

Freely the gift of God receive,

And peace in Jesus find,

And peace in Jesus find.



# 3

I bid you all my goodness prove;

My promises are free:

Come, taste the manna of my love,

Delight your souls in me,

Delight your souls in me.
