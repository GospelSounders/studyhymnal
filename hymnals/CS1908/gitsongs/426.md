426 – God Made Them


1
Each little flow'r that opens,
Each little bird that sings;
God made their glowing colors,
He made their tiny wings;

2
The purple-headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset and the morning,
That brighten up the sky;

3
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
God made them ev'ry one.

4
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.
