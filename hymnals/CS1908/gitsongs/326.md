# 1

To Thee, O dear, dear Saviour!

My spirit turns for rest,

My peace is in Thy favor,

My pillow on Thy breast;

Tho' all the world deceive me,

I know that I am Thine,

And Thou wilt never leave me,

O blessed Saviour mine.



# 2

In Thee my trust abideth,

On Thee my hope relies,

O Thou whose love provideth

For all beneath the skies;

It was Thy mercy found me,

From bondage set me free,

And then for ever bound me

With threefold cords to Thee.



# 3

My grief is in the dullness

With which this sluggish heart

Doth open to the fullness

Of all Thou wouldst impart;

My hope is in Thy beauty

Of holiness divine,

My joy is in the duty

That binds my life in Thine.  Amen
