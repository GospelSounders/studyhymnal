# 1

Thine is the glory,

Risen, conquering Son;

Endless is the victory thou o’er death hast won.

Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,

Kept the folded grave-clothes where Thy body lay.



# Refrain

Thine is the glory,

Risen, conquering Son;

Endless is the victory Thou o’er death hast won.



# 2

Lo! Jesus meets us.

Risen from the tomb,

Lovingly He greets us,

Scatters fear and gloom;

Let His Church with gladness hymns of triumph sing,

For her Lord now liveth;

Death has lost its sting.



# 3

No more we doubt Thee,

Glorious Prince of life!

Life is nought without Thee;

Aid us in our strife;

Make us more than conquerors through Thy deathless love

Bring us safe through Jordan to Thy home above.
