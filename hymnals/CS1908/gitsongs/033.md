# 1

We are building in sorrow or joy

A temple the world may not see,

Which time cannot mar nor destroy:

We build for eternity.



Chorus:

We are building, ev'ry day,

A temple the world may not see;

Building, building ev'ry day,

Building for eternity!



# 2

Ev'ry tho't that we've ever had,

Its own little place has fill'd;

Ev'ry deed we have done, good or bad,

Is a stone in the temple we build.  [Chorus]



# 3

Ev'ry word that so lightly falls,

Giving some heart joy or pain,

Will shine in our temple wall,

Or ever its beauty stain.  [Chorus]



# 4

Are you building for God alone?

Are you building in faith and love,

A temple the Father will own,

In the city of light above?  [Chorus]
