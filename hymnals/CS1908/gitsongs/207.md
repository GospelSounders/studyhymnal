# 1

"There shall be showers of blessing:"

This is the promise of love;

There shall be seasons refreshing,

Sent from the Saviour above.



Chorus:

Showers, showers of blessing,

Showers of blessing we need;

Mercy drops round us are falling,

But for the showers we plead.



# 2

"There shall be showers of blessing"

Precious reviving again;

Over the hills and the valleys,

Sound of abundance of rain.  [Chorus]



# 3

"There shall be showers of blessing:"

Send them upon us, O Lord;

Grant to us now a refreshing,

Come, and now honor Thy Word.  [Chorus]



# 4

"There shall be showers of blessing;"

Oh, that today they might fall,

Now as to God we're confessing,

Now as on Jesus we call!  [Chorus]
