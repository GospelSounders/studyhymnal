# 1

“Go, preach My gospel,” saith the Lord;

“Bid the whole world My grace receive;

He shall be saved who trusts My word,

And they condemned who disbelieve.



# 2

“I’ll make your great commission known,

And ye shall prove My gospel true

By all the works that I have done,

By all the wonders ye shall do.



# 3

“Teach all the nations My commands;

I’m with you till the world shall end;

All power is vested in My hands;

I can destroy, and I defend.”



# 4

He spake, and light shone round His head;

On a bright cloud to heaven He rode;

They to the farthest nations spread

The grace of their ascended Lord.
