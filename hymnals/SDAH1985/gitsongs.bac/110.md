# 1

God’s free mercy streameth over all the world,

And His banner gleameth, By His church unfuried;

Broad and deep and glorious, As the heaven above,

Shines in might victorious His eternal love.



# 2

Summer suns are glowing over land and sea;

Happy light is flowing, Bountiful and free;

Everything rejoices in the mellow rays;

Earth’s ten thousand voices swell the psalm of praise.



# 3

Lord, upon our blindness thy pure radiance pour;

For Thy loving kindness we would love Thee more;

And when clouds are drifting dark across the sky,

Then, the veil uplifting, father, be Thou nigh.



# 4

We will never doubt Thee, tho’ veil Thy light;

Life is dark without Thee, death with Thee is bright.

Light of light, shine o’er us on our pilgrim way,

Go Thou still before us to the endless day.
