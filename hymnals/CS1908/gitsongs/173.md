# 1

To-day the Saviour calls;

Ye wand'rers, come;

O ye benighted souls,

Why longer roam?



# 2

To-day the Saviour calls;

Oh, hear him now;

Within these sacred walls

To Jesus bow.



# 3

To-day the Saviour calls;

For refuge fly;

The storm of justice falls,

And death is nigh.



# 4

The Spirit calls to-day;

Yield to his pow'r,

Oh, grieve him not away,

'Tis mercy's hour.
