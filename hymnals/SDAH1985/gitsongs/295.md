# 1

Chief of sinners though I be,

Jesus shed His blood for me;

Died that I might live on high,

Died that I might never die;

As the brance is to the vine,

I am His, and He is mine.



# 2

O the height of Jesus’ love!

Higher than the heaven above,

Deeper than the deepest sea,

Lasting as eternity;

Love that found me-wondrous thought!

Found me when I sought Him not!



# 3

Chief of sinners though I be,

Christ is all in all to me;

All my wants to Him are known,

All my sorrows are His own;

Safe with Him from earthly strife,

He sustains the hidden life.
