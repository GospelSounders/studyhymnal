# 1

O let me walk with thee, my God,

As Enoch walked in days of old;

Place thou my trembling hand in thine,

And sweet communion with me hold;

E'en tho' the path I May not see,

Yet, Jesus, let me walk with thee.



# 2

I can not, dare not walk alone;

The tempest rages in the sky;

A thousand snares beset my feet,

A thousand foes are lurking nigh;

Still thou the raging of the sea;

O Master, let me walk with thee.



# 3

If I may rest my hand in thine,

I'll count the joys of earth but loss,

And firmly, bravely journey on;

I'll bear the banner of the cross

Till Zion's glorious gates I see:

Yet, Saviour, let me walk with thee.
