1.

The Homeland!  O the Homeland!

The land of the freeborn!

There's no night in the Homeland,

But aye the fadeless morn;

I'm sighing for the Homeland,

My heart is aching here;

There is no pain in the Homeland

To which I'm drawing near;

There is no pain in the Homeland

To which I'm drawing near.



2.

My Lord is in the Homeland,

With angels bright and fair;

There's no sin in the Homeland,

And no temptation there;

The music of the Homeland

Is ringing in my ears;

And when I think of the Homeland

My eyes are filled with tears;

And when I think of the Homeland

My eyes are filled with tears.



3.

The dwellers in the Homeland

Are beck'ning me to come,

Where neither death nor sorrow 

Invades their holy home;

O dear, dear native country!

O rest and peace above!

Christ bring us all to the Homeland

Of Thy redeeming love;

Christ bring us all to the Homeland

Of Thy redeeming love.
