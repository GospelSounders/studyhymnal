# 1

Did Christ o'er sinners weep?

And shall our cheeks be dry?

Let floods of penitential grief

Burst forth from ev'ry eye.



# 2

The Son of God in tears,

The wond'ring angels see!

Be thou astonished, O my soul!

He shed those tears for thee.



# 3

He wept; shall we not weep?

He died; shall we not die?

He rose; shall we not rise from sleep,

To reign with him on high?
