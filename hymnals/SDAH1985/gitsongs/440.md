# 1

How cheering is the Christian’s hope,

While toiling here below!

It bouys us up while this passing through

This wilderness of woe,



# 2

It bouys us up while this passing through

This wilderness of woe,

It bouys us up while passing through

This wilderness of woe.



# 3

It points us to a land of rest,

Where saints with Christ will reign;

Where we shall meet the loved of earth,

And never part again.



# 4

Fly, lingering moments, fly, O, fly,

Dear Savior, quickly come!

We long to see Thee as Thou art,

And reach that blissful home.
