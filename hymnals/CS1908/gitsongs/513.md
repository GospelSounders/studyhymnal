# 1

Ask not to be excused,

There's earnest work to do;

Stand ready to be used

Where God may station you.

His invitation kind

To thee has oft been giv'n;

Accept, and thou shalt find

'Tis sweet to work for Heav'n.



Chorus:

Come, O come!

Ask not to be excused;

Come, O come!

Stand ready to be used.

Ask not to be excused,

This answer may be giv'n:

Thou hast my love abused,

Thou art excused from heav'n.



# 2

Ask not to be excused,

The Master calls today;

Too long hast thou refused,

Now hasten to obey.

The harvest fields are white,

The laborers are few;

Let this be thy delight,

The Master's work to do  [Chorus]



# 3

Ask not to be excused,

There's danger in delay;

That wondrous love abused,

Forever turns away.

While Mercy gently pleads

And points the way to heav'n,

While Jesus intercedes,

O come and be forgiv'n!  [Chorus]
