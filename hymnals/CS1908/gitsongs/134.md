# 1

Baptize us anew

With pow'r from on high,

With love, O refresh us!

Dear Saviour, draw nigh.



Chorus:

We humbly beseech thee, Lord, Jesus, we pray,

With love and the Spirit baptize us to-day.



# 2

Unworthy we cry,

Unholy, unclean, 

O wash us and cleanse us

From sin's guilty stain.  [Chorus]



# 3

O heavenly dove,

Descend from on high!

We plead thy rich blessing;

In mercy draw nigh.  [Chorus]



# 4

O list the glad voice!

From heaven it came:

Thou art my beloved,

Well pleased I am.



Chorus:

We praise thee, we bless the, dear Lamb that was slain

We land and adore thee, Amen and Amen.
