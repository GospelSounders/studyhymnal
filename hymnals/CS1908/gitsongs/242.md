# 1

A beautiful star arose one night,

Divinely it shone with purest light;

Its wonderful rays the wise men led

To find the Saviour's lowly bed.



Chorus:

'Tis shining still, 'tis shining still,

That beautiful star, o'er plain and hill;

'Tis shining still, 'tis shining still,

Salvation's star of God's good will.



# 2

They knew by the word of truth divine,

'Twas time that the star should shine;

They follow'd its light which shone afar,

'Twas Christ, "the bright and Morning Star."  [Chorus]



# 3

We'll follow its light, like those of old,

The "Light of the World," by seers foretold;

We'll follow his light till we shall come

To perfect rest in heav'n, our home.  [Chorus]
