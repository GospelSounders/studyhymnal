# 1

High in the heav'ns, eternal God,

Thy goodness in full glory shines;

Thy truth shall break thro' ev'ry cloud

That vails thy just and wise designs.



# 2

Forever firm thy justice stands,

As mountains their foundations keep;

Wise as the wonders of thy hands,

Thy judgments are a mighty deep.



# 3

O God, how excellent thy grace,

Whence all our hope and comfort spring!

The sons of Adam, in distress,

Fly to the shadow of thy wing.
