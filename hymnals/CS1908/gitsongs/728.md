1.

We bless Thee for Thy peace, O God,

Deep as th' unfathomed sea,

Which falls like sunshine on the road

Of those who trust in Thee.



2.

We ask not, Father, for repose

Which comes from outward rest,

If we may have thro' all life's woes

Thy peace within our breast,



3.

That peace which suffers and is strong

Trusts where it cannot see,

Deems not the trial way too long,

But leaves the end with Thee.



4.

That peace which flows serene and deep

A river in the soul

Whose banks a living verdure keep,

God's sunshine o'er the whole.



5.

O Father, give our hearts this peace,

Whate'er the outward be,

Till all life's discipline shall cease,

And we go home to Thee.
