# 1

Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,

Weak and wounded, sick and sore;

Jesus ready stands to save you,

Full of pity, love, and pow'r.



Chorus:

Turn to the Lord, and seek salvation,

Sound the praise of his dear name;

Glory, honor, and salvation,

Christ the Lord is come to reign.



# 2

Now ye needy, come and welcome,

God's free bounty glorify;

True belief and true repentance,

Ev'ry grace that brings you nigh.  [Chorus]



# 3

Let not conscience make you linger,

Nor of fitness fondly dream;

All the fitness he requireth

Is to feel our need of him.  [Chorus]



# 4

Come, ye weary, heavy-laden,

Bruised and mangled by the fall,

If you tarry till you're better,

You will never come at all.  [Chorus]
