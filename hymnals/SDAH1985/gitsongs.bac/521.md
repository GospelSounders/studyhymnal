# 1

Depth of mercy!–can there be

Mercy still reserved for me?

Can my God His wrath forbear?

Me, the chief of sinners, spare?



# 2

I have long withstood His grace,

Long provoked Him to His face,

Would not hearken to His calls,

Grieved Him by a thousand falls.



# 3

Now incline me to repent;

Let me now my sins lament;

Now my foul revolt deplore,

Weep, believe, and sin no more.



# 4

There for me the Savior stands,

Shows His wounds and spreads His hands;

God is love! I know, I feel;

Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
