# 1

O praise ye the Lord!

Praise Him in the height;

Rejoice in His word,

Ye angels of light;

Ye heavens, adore Him

By whom ye were made,

And worship before Him,

In brightness arrayed.



# 2

O praise ye the Lord!

Praise Him upon earth,

In tuneful accord:

Ye sons of new birth;

Praise Him who hath brought

you His grace from above,

Praise Him who hath taught

you To sing of His love.



# 3

O praise ye the Lord,

All things that give sound;

Each jubilant chord,

Re-echo around;

Loud organs His glory

Forth tell in deep tone,

And sweet harp, the story

Of what He hath done.



# 4

O praise ye the Lord!

Thanksgiving and song

To Him be outpoured

All ages along:

For love in creation,

For heaven restored.

For grace of salvation,

O praise ye the Lord!
