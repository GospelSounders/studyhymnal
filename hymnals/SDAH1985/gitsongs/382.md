# 1

O day of rest and gladness,

O day of joy and light,

O balm of care and sadness,

most beautiful, most bright;

on thee, the high and lowly,

who bend before throne,

sing, “Holy, holy, holy,”

to the Eternal One.



# 2

Thou art a port protected

from storms that round us rise;

a garden intersected

with streams of paradise;

thou art a cooling fountain

in life’s dry, dreary sand;

from thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,

we view our promised land.



# 3

A day of sweet reflection,

thou art a day of love,

A day to raise affection

from earth to things above.

New graces ever gaining

from this our day of rest,

We reach the rest remaining

in mansions of the blessed.
