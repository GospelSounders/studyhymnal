1.

Some day the silver cord will break,

And I no more as now shall sing;

But, O, the joy when I shall wake

Within the palace of the King!



Chorus:

And I shall see Him face to face,

And tell the story  Saved by grace!

And I shall see Him face to face,

And tell the story  Saved by grace.



2.

Some day my earthly house will fall,

I cannot tell how soon 'twill be,

But this I know my All in All

Has now a place in heav'n for me.  [Chorus]



3.

Some day, when fades the golden sun

Beneath the rosy-tinted west,

My blessed Lord shalt say, "Well done!"

And I shall enter into rest.  [Chorus]



4.

Someday; till then I'll watch and wait,

My lamp all trimmed and burning bright.

That when my Saviour ope's the gate, 

My soul to Him may take its flight.  [Chorus]
