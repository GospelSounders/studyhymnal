1.

Above the clouds that veil the blue

Beyond the stars that glimmer through,

There is a home unknown to care,

Its gates ajar invite me there.



Chorus:

O home of beauty, free from sorrow!

O everlasting glad tomorrow!



2.

The stream of life with ceaseless flow,

The holy joy that angels know,

The golden harp, the song divine,

The spotless robe Faith calls them mine.  [Chorus]



3.

The flow'rs that sleep neath winter's snow.

The loves ones lost to us below,

The voices hush'd that used to sing,

We'll find them where Christ is King.  [Chorus]
