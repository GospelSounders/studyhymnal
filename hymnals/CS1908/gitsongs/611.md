# 1

All the way my Saviour leads me;

What have I to ask beside?

Can I doubt His tender mercy,

Who thro' life has been my guide?

Heav'nly peace, divinest comfort,

Here by faith in Him to dwell!

For I know whate'er befall me,

Jesus doeth all things well;

For I know whate'er befall me,

Jesus doeth all things well.



# 2

All the way my Saviour leads me;

Cheers each winding path I tread;

Gives me grace for every trial,

Feeds me with the living bread;

Tho' my weary steps may falter,

And my soul athirst may be,

Gushing from the Rock before me,

Lo!  a spring of joy I see;

Gushing from the rock before me,

Lo!  a spring of joy I see.



# 3

All the way my Saviour leads me;

Oh, the fullness of His love!

Perfect rest to me is promised

In my Father's house above;

When I wake to life immortal,

Wing my flight to realms of day,

This my song thro' endless ages

Jesus led me all the way;

This my song thro' endless ages

Jesus led me all the way.
