# 1

Come, children, hail the Prince of Peace

Obey the Saviour's call;

Come, seek His face and taste His grace,

And crown Him Lord of all.



Chorus:

In the dewy time of youth, let us come,

Before the brown leaves fall;

He will guide us with His truth, let us come,

And crown Him Lord of all.



# 2

Ye lambs of Christ, your tribute bring,

Ye children, great and small;

Hosanna sing to Christ your King,

And crown Him Lord of all.  [Chorus]



# 3

This Jesus will your sins forgive,

O haste!  before Him fall;

For you He died, that you might live

To crown Him Lord of all.  [Chorus]
