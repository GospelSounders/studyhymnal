# 1

Let the whole Creation cry

Glory to the Lord on high!

Heav'n and earth, awake and sing

"God is good, and therefore King."



# 2

Praise Him, all ye hosts above,

Praise Him, Lord of life and love!

Sun and moon, uplift your voice,

Night and stars, in God rejoice.



# 3

Rivers roll His praise along,

Ocean chant His anthem song!

Sunshine, darkness, cloud and storm,

Rain and snow His praise perform.



# 4

Kings of knowledge and of law,

To the glorious circle draw;

All who work and all who wait,

Sing, "The Lord is good and great."
