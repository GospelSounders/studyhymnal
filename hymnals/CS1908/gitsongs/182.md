# 1

See, Israel's gentle shepherd stands,

With all-engaging charms;

Hark, how He calls the tender lambs.

And folds them in His arms!



# 2

"Permit them to approach," He cries,

"Nor scorn their humble name;

For 'twas to bless such souls as these,

The Lord of angels came."



# 3

We bring them, Lord, in thankful hands,

And yield them up to Thee;

Joyful that we ourselves are Thine,

Thine let our offspring be.
