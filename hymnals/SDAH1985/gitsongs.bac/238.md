# 1

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds

In a believer’s ear!

It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,

And drives away his fear.



# 2

It makes the wounded spirit whole,

And calms the troubled breast;

“Tis manna to the hungry soul,

And to the weary, rest.



# 3

Dear name, the rock on which I build,

My shield and hiding place,

My neverfailing treasury, filled

With boundless stores of grace.



# 4

Jesus! my Shepherd, Guardian, Friend,

My Prophet, Priest, and King!

My Lord, my life, my way, my end!

Accept the praise I bring.



# 5

Weak is the effort of my heart,

And cold my warmest thought;

But when I see Thee as Thou art,

I’ll praise Thee as I ought.
