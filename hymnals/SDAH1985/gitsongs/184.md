# 1

I hear the Savior say,

“Thy strength indeed is small;

Child of weakness, watch and pray,

Find in Me thine all in all.”



# Refrain

Jesus paid it all,

All to Him I owe;

Sin had left a crimson stain,

He washed it white as snow.



# 2

Lord, now indeed I find

Thy power and Thine alone,

Can change the leper’s spots

And melt the heart of stone.



# 3

Since nothing good have I

Whereby Thy grace to claim,

I’ll wash my garments white

In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.



# 4

And when before the throne

I stand in Him complete,

I’ll lay my trophies down

All down at Jesus’ feet.
