# 1

God bids his people on the earth,

Before he comes and calls them hence

To live unknit to home and hearth,

Like far bound travelers in tents.



Chorus:

We'll live in tents until our feet

Shall reach the land by sin untrod,

The gate of pearl, the golden street,

Whose Builder and whose Maker, God.



# 2

It is his will that we should pass

Like strangers, sep'rate and aside

From all the vain and worldly mass

That crowd the Babylons of pride.  [Chorus]



# 3

He'd have us rear no stately towers,

Sink no foundation walls of stone,

But camp each night a few short hours,

And ere the morrow's dawn move on.  [Chorus]



# 4

O brother, whatsoever chain

Binds us to fleshly lust and strife,

Here let us rend it in God's name,

And live, henceforth, the pilgrim life.  [Chorus]
