# 1

O thou to whom, in ancient time,

The psalmist's sacred harp was strung,

Whom kings adored in songs sublime,

And prophets praised with glowing tongue,



# 2

From ev'ry place below the skies,

The grateful song, the fervent prayer

The incense of the heart may rise

To heav'n, and find acceptance there.



# 3

To thee shall age, with snowy hair,

And strength, and beauty, bend the knee,

And childhood lisp with rev'rent air

Its praises and its prayers to thee.
