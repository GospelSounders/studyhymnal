# 1

Softy and tenderly Jesus is calling,

Calling for you and for me;

At the heart's portal He's waiting and watching,

Watching for you and for me.



Chorus:

Come home, come home,

Ye who are weary, come home;

Earnestly tenderly, Jesus is calling,

Calling, O sinner, come home!



# 2

Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,

Pleading for you and for me;

Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,

Mercies for you and for me?  [Chorus]



# 3

Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,

Passing from you and from me;

Shadows are gath'ring and death's night is coming,

Coming for you and for me.  [Chorus]



# 4

Think of the wonderful love He has promised,

Promised for you and for me;

Tho' we have sinned He has mercy and pardon,

Pardon for you and for me.  [Chorus]
