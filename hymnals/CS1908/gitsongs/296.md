# 1

Walking with thee, my God,

Saviour benign,

Daily confer on me

Converse divine;

Jesus, in thee restores,

Brother, and blessed Lord,

Let it be mine,

Let it be mine.



# 2

Walking with thee, my God,

Like as a child

Leans on his father's strength,

Crossing the wild.

And by the way is taught

Lessons of holy tho't,

Faith undefiled,

Faith undefiled.



# 3

Walking with thee, my God,

Humbly with thee;

Yet from all care and fear

Lovingly free.

E'en as a friend with friend,

Chee'rd to the journey's end,

Walking with thee,

Walking with thee.
