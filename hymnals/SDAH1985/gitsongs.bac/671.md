Now, dear Lord, as we pray,

take our hearts and minds far away

from the press of the world all around

to your throne where grace does abound.

May our lives be transformed by Your love,

may our souls be refreshed from above.

At this moment, let people everywhere

join us now as we come to You in prayer.
