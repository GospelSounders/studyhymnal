1.

I'm but a stranger here,

Heav'n is my home;

Earth is a desert drear,

Heav'n is my home;

Danger and sorrow stand 

Round me on ev'ry hand,

Heav'n is my Fatherland,

Heav'n is my home.



2.

What though the tempest rage,

Heaven is my home;

Short is my pilgrimage,

Heaven is my home.

Time's cold and wintry blast

Soon will be overpast;

I shall reach home at last;

Heaven is my home.



3.

There at my Saviour's side,

Heaven is my home,

I shall be glorified,

Heaven is my home.

There'll be the good and blest,

Those I love most and best;

There, too, I soon shall rest;

Heaven is my home.
