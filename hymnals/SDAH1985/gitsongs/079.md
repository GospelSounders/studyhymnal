# 1

O love of God, how strong and true!

Eternal, and yet ever new;

Uncomprehended and unbought,

Beyond all knowledge and all thought.



# 2

O love of God, how deep and great,

Far deeper than man’s deepest hate;

Self-fed, self-kindled like the light,

Changeless, eternal, infinite.



# 3

We read thee best in Him who cam

To bear for us the cross of shame;

Sent by the Father from on high,

Our life to live, our death to die.



# 4

We read thy power to bless and save,

E’en in the darkness of the grave;

Still more in resurrection light

We read the fullness of thy might.



# 5

O love of God, our shield and stay

Through all the perils of our way!

Eternal love, in thee we rest,

Forever safe, forever blest.
