1.

Awake my soul!  stretch ev'ry nerve,

And press with vigor on;

A heav'nly race demands thy zeal,

And an immortal crown.



2.

'Tis God's all animating voice,

That calls thee from on high;

'Tis he whose hand presents the prize

To thine aspiring eye.



3.

A cloud of witnesses around,

Hold thee in full survey;

Forget the steps already trod,

And onward urge thy way.



4.

Blest Saviour, introduced by thee,

Our race have we begun;

And, crown'd with vict'ry, at thy feet

We'll lay our trophies down.
