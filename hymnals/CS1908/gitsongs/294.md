# 1

My hope is built on nothing less

Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;

I dare not trust the sweetest frame,

But wholly lean on Jesus' name.



Refrain:

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;

All other ground is sinking sand,

All other ground is sinking sand.



# 2

When darkness seems to veil his face,

I rest on his unchanging grace;

In ev'ry high and stormy gale,

My anchor holds within the vail.  [Refrain]



# 3

His oath, his covenant, and blood,

Support me in the whelming flood;

When all around my soul gives way,

He then is all my hope and stay.  [Refrain]



# 4

When he shall come with trumpet sound,

O may I then in him be found;

Clad in his righteousness alone,

Faultless to stand before the throne.  [Refrain]
