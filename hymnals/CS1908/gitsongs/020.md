# 1

Christ is knocking at my sad heart;

Shall I let him in?

Patiently pleading with my sad heart;

O shall I let him in?

Cold and proud is my heart with sin,

Dark and cheerless is all within;

Christ is bidding me turn unto him;

O shall I let him in?



# 2

Shall I send him the loving word?

Shall I let him in?

Meekly accepting my gracious Lord,

O shall I let him in?

He can infinite love impart,

He can pardon this rebel heart;

Shall I bid him forever depart,

Or shall I let him in?



# 3

Yes, I'll open this heart's proud decor,

Yes, I'll let him in.

Gladly I'll welcome him evermore;

O, yes, I'll let him in.

Blessed Saviour, abide with me,

Cares and trials will lighter be;

I am safe if I'm only with thee,

O, blessed Lord, come in!
