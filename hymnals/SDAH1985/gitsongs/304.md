# 1

Faith of our fathers, living still,

In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;

O how our hearts beat high with joy

Whenever we hear that glorious Word!

Faith of our fathers, holy faith!

We will be true to thee till death.



# 2

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,

Were still in heart and conscience free:

How sweet would be their children’s fate.

If they, like them, could die for thee!

Faith of our fathers, holy faith!

We will be true to thee till death.



# 3

Faith of our fathers, we will love

Both friend and foe in all our strife;

And preach Thee, too, as love knows how

By kindly words and virtuous life.

Faith of our fathers, holy faith!

We will be true to thee till death.
