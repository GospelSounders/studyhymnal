# 1

There’s no other name like Jesus,

‘Tis the dearest name we know,

‘Tis the angel’s joy in heaven,

‘Tis the Christian’s joy below.



# Refrain

Sweet name, (sweet name) dear name, (dear name)

There’s no other name like Jesus;

Sweet name, (sweet name) dear name, (dear name)

There’s no other name like Jesus.



# 2

There’s no other name like Jesus

When the heart with grief is sad,

There’s no other name like Jesus

When the heart is free and glad.



# 3

‘Tis the hope that I shall see Him

When in glory He appears,

‘Tis the hope to hear His welcome

That my fainting spirit cheers.



# 4

If He wills that I should labor

In His vineyard day by day,

Then ’tis well if only Jesus

Blesses all I do or say.



# 5

If He wills that death’s cold finger

Touch my feeble, mortal clay,

Then ’tis well if only Jesus

Is my dying trust and stay.
