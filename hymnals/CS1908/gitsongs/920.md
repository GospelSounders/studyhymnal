1.

There is sweet rest for feet now weary,

In the rugged, upward way;

There is a morn when midnight dreary

Shall be lost in perfect day.



2.

For that blest morn our hearts are longing,

When shall end earth's night of woe;

When, thro' those pearly portals thronging,

Mortal cares we leave below.



3.

Soon to that city, bright, eternal,

Weary pilgrims all shall go;

Soon we shall rest in pastures vernal,

Where life's waters ceaseless flow.



4.

Father above, in mercy guide us

To those mansions of the blest;

Safe in the Rock of Ages hide us

Till we gain our final rest.
