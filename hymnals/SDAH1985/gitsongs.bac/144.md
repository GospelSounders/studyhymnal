# 1

O sing a song of Bethlehem,

Of shepherds watching there,

And of the news that came to them

From angels in the air:

The light that shone on Bethlehem

Fills all the world today;

Of Jesus’birth and peace on earth

The angels sing alway.



# 2

O sing a song of Nazareth,

Of sunny days of joy,

O sing of fragrant flowers breath,

And of the sinless Boy:

For now the flowers of Nazareth

In every heart may grow;

Now spreads the fame of His dear name

On all the winds that blow.



# 3

O sing a song of Calvary,

Its glory and dismay;

Of Him who hung upon the tree,

And took our sins away:

For He who died on Calvary

Is risen from the grave;

And Christ, our Lord, by heaven adored,

Is mighty now to save.
