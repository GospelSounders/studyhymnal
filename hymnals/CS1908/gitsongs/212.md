# 1

Alas!  and did my Saviour bleed,

And did my Sov'reign die?

Would he devote that sacred head 

For such a worm as I?



Chorus:

At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light,

And the burden of my heart rolled away,

It was there by faith I received my sight,

And now I am happy all the day.



# 2

Was it for deeds that I have done,

He groaned upon the tree?

Amazing pity, grace unknown,

And love beyond degree!  [Chorus]



# 3

But drops of grief can ne'er repay

The debt of love I owe;

Here, Lord I give myself away,

'Tis all that I can do!  [Chorus]
