# 1

Nothing between my soul and my Savior,

naught of this world’s delusive dream;

I have renounced all sinful pleasure;

Jesus is mine, there’s nothing between.



# Refrain

Nothing between my soul and my Savior,

so that his blessed face may be seen;

nothing preventing the least of his favor;

keep the way clear! let nothing between.



# 2

Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;

habits of life, though harmless they seem,

must not my heart from him ever sever;

he is my all, there’s nothing between.



# 3

Nothing between, e’en many hard trials,

though the whole world against me convene;

watching with prayer and much self denial,

I’ll triumph at last, there’s nothing between.
