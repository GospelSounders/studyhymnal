# 1

Live out Thy life within me,

O Jesus, King of kings!

Be Thou Thyself the answer

To all my questionings;

Live out Thy life within me,

In all things have Thy way!

I, the transparent medium

Thy glory to display.



# 2

The temple has been yielded,

And purified of sin;

Let Thy Shekinah glory

Now shine forth from within,

And all the earth keep silence,

The body henceforth be

Thy silent, gentle servant,

Moved only as by Thee,



# 3

Its members ev'ry moment

Held subject to Thy call,

Ready to have Thee use them,

Or not be used at all;

Held without restless longing,

Or strain, or stress, or fret,

Or chafings at Thy dealings,

Or tho'ts of vain regret;



# 4

But restful, calm and pliant,

From bend and bias free,

Awaiting Thy decision,

When thou hast need of me.

Live out Thy life within me,

O Jesus, King of kings!

Be Thou the glorious answer

To all my questionings.
