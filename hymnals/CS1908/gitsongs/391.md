# 1

Come, thou almighty King,

Help us thy name to sing,

Help us to praise.

Father all glorious,

O'er all victorious,

Come, and reign over us,

Ancient of Days.



# 2

Come, holy Comforter,

Thy sacred witness bear

In this glad hour:

Thou who almighty art,

Rule now in ev'ry heart,

And ne'er from us depart,

Spirit of pow'r.



# 3

Thou art the mighty One,

On earth thy will be done,

From shore to shore.

Thy sov'reign majesty 

May we in glory see,

And to eternity

Love and adore.
