# 1

My faith looks up to thee,

thou Lamb of Calvary,

Savior divine;

Now hear me while I pray,

take all my guilt away,

O let me from this day

be wholly Thine.



# 2

May thy rich grace impart

strength to my fainting heart,

my zeal inspire!

As thou hast died for me,

O may my love to thee

pure, warm, and changeless be,

a living fire!



# 3

While life’s dark maze I tread,

and griefs around me spread,

be thou my guide;

bid darkness turn to day,

wipe sorrow’s tears away,

nor let me ever stray

from Thee aside.
