# 1

Arise, my soul, arise!

Stretch forth to things eternal

And hasten to the feet of your Redeemer God.

Though hid from mortal eyes,

He dwells in light supernal;

Yet worship Him in humbleness and call Him Lord.

His banquet of love

Awaits you above;

Yet here He grants a foretaste of the feast

to come!

Rejoice, my soul, rejoice,

To heav’n lift up your voice:

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!



# 2

Now hear the harps of heav’n!

Oh, hear the song victorious,

The never-ending anthem sounding

through the sky!

To mortals is not giv’n

To join in strains so glorious;

Yet here on earth we too can sing

our praises high!

He bought with His blood

The ransomed of God;

To Him be everlasting pow’r and victory.

And let the great amen

Resound through heav’n again.

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
