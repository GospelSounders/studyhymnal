# 1

Christ is the world’s light,

Christ and none other;

born in our darkness,

He became our brother-

if we have seen Him,

we have seen the Father:

Glory to God on high!



# 2

Christ is the world’s peace,

Christ and none other;

no one can serve Him,

and despise another.

Who else unites us,

one in God the Father?

Glory to God on high!



# 3

Christ is the world’s life,

Christ and none other;

sold once for silver,

murdered here, our brother-

He, who redeems us,

reigns with God the Father:

Glory to God on high!



# 4

Give God the glory,

God and none other;

give God the glory,

Spirit, Son and Father;

give God the glory,

God-with-us our brother:

Glory to God on high!
