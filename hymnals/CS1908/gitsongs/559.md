# 1

If any little word of mine

May make a dark life brighter,

If any little song of mine

May make a sad heart lighter.



Chorus:

God help me speak the helping word,

And sweeten it with singing.

And drop it in some lonely vale, 

To set the echoes ringing.



# 2

If any little love of mine

May make a hard life sweeter,

If any little care of mine

May make a friend's the fleeter.  [Chorus]



# 3

If any little lift of mine

May ease a toiler bending,

God give me love, and care, and strength,

We live for Him by lending.  [Chorus]
