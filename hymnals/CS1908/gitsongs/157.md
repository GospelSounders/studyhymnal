# 1

The day of wrath, that dreadful day,

When heav'n and earth shall pass away!

What pow'r shall be the sinner's stay?

How shall he meet that dreadful day?



# 2

When shriv'ling like a parched scroll,

The flaming heav'ns together roll,

And louder yet, and yet more dread,

Resounds the trump that wakes the dead,



# 3

On that great day, that wrathful day,

When man to Judgment wakes from clay,

Be thou, O Christ, thy people's stay,

Tho' heav'n and earth shall pass away.
