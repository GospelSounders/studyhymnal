1.

Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness;

Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more.

Bright, o'er thy hills, dawns the day star of gladness,

Arise, for the night of thy sorrow is o'er.



Chorus:

Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness;

Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more.



2.

 Strong were thy foes; but the arm that subdued them,

And scattered their legions, was mightier far;

They fled like the chaff from the scourge that pursued them;

In vain were their steeds and their chariots of war.  [Chorus]



3.

Daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee,

Extolled with the harp and the timbrel shall be;

Shout:  for the foe is destroyed that enslaved thee;

Th' oppressor is vanquished, and Zion is free.  [Chorus]
