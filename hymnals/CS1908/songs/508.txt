508 â€“ Stand Like the Brave


1
O Christian, awake!  'tis the Master's command;
With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand,
To meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go,
And stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

Chorus:
Stand like the brave, stand like the brave,
Stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
