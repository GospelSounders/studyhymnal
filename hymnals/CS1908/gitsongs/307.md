# 1

When softly falls the twilight hour,

O'er moor and mountain, field and flow'r,

How sweet to leave a world of care,

And lift to heav'n the voice of pray'r!



# 2

In solemn midnight's silence deep,

When Nature's voice is hush'd in sleep,

Then heavy hearts with grief oppress'd

May find in pray'r the sweetest rest.



# 3

And when with red'ning blush of morn

The newborn day begins to dawn,

Then upward to the mercy-seat

Let pray'r ascend like incense sweet.



# 4

When midday's burning heat we feel,

When daily cares our hearts would steal,

O, then to heav'n we look away,

And find in pray'r our surest stay.
