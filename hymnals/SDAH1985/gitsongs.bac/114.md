# 1

There’s a wideness, in God’s mercy,

like the wideness of the sea;

There is mercy, with the Savior,

Which is more than liberty.



# 2

There is welcome, for the sinner,

and more graces for the good;

There is mercy, with the Savior,

There is healing in His blood.



# 3

For the love of God is broader

Than the measure of man’s mind.

And the heart of the Eternal,

is most wonderfully kind.



# 4

If our love were but more simple,

We should take Him at His word;

And our lives would be all sunshine,

In the sweetness of our Lord.
