# 1

This is My will, My one command,

That love should dwell among you all.

This is My will that you should love

As I have shown that I love you.



# 2

No greater love a man can have

Than that he die to save his friends.

You are My friends if you obey

What I command that you should do.



# 3

You chose not Me, but I chose you

That you should go and bear much fruit.

I chose you out that you in Me

Should bear much fruit that will abide.



# 4

All that I ask My Father, dear,

For My name’s sake you shall receive.

This is My will, My one command,

That love should dwell in each, in all.
