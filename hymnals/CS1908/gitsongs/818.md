1.

God bless our native land!

May Heaven's protecting hand

Still guard our shore.

May peace her pow'r extend,

Foe be transformed to friend,

And all our rights depend

On war no more.



2.

May just and righteous laws

Uphold the public cause,

And bless our name;

Home of the brave and free,

Stronghold of Liberty,

We pray that still on thee

May rest no stain.



3.

And not this land alone,

But be thy mercies known

From shore to shore;

O that all men would see

That they should brothers be,

And form one family,

The wide world o'er!
