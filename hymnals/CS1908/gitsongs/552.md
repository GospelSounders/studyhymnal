# 1

I am thinking today of that beautiful land,

I shall reach when the sun goeth down;

When thro' wonderful grace by my Saviour I stand,

Will there be any stars in my crown?



Chorus:

Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown,

When at evening the sun goeth down?

When I wake with the blest

In the mansions of rest,

Will there be any stars in my crown?



# 2

In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray;

Let me watch as a winner of souls;

That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day,

When His praise like the sea billows rolls.  [Chorus]



# 3

O what joy will it be when His face I behold,

Living gems at His feet to lay down;

It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold, 

Should there be any stars in my crown.  [Chorus]
