# 1

He reigns!  the Lord, the Saviour reigns!

Sing to his name in lofty strains,

Let all the saints in songs rejoice,

And in his praise exalt their voice.



# 2

Deep are his counsels, and unknown.

But grace and truth support his throne;

Tho' gloomy clouds his way surround,

Justice is their eternal ground.



# 3

In robes of judgment, lo, he comes!

Shakes the wide earth, and cleaves the tombs;

Before him burns devouring fire,

The mountains melt, the seas retire.
