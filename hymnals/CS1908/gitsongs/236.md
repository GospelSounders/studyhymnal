# 1

I have a song I love to sing,

Since I have been redeem'd;

Of my Redeemer, my Saviour, King,

Since I have been redeem'd.



Chorus:

Since I have been redeem'd,

Since I have been redeem'd, 

I will glory in His name;

Since I have been redeem'd,

I will glory in my Saviour's name.



# 2

I have a Christ that satisfies,

Since I have been redeem'd;

To do His will my highest prize,

Since I have been redeem'd.  [Chorus]



# 3

I have a witness bright and clear,

Since I have been redeem'd;

Dispelling ev'ry doubt and fear,

Since I have been redeem'd.  [Chorus]



# 4

I have a home prepared for me,

Since I have been redeem'd;

Where I shall dwell eternally,

Since I have been redeem'd.  [Chorus]
