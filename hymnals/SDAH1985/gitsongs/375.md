# 1

Work for the night is coming,

Work through the morning hours;

Work while the dew is sparkling;

Work ‘mid springing flow’rs.

Work when the day grows brighter,

Work in the glowing sun;

Work for the night is coming,

When man’s work is done.



# 2

Work for the night is coming,

Work thro’ the sunny noon;

Fill brightest hours with labor,

Rest comes sure and soon.

Give every flying minute

Something to keep in store;

Work for the night is coming,

When man works no more.



# 3

Work for the night is coming,

Under the sunset skies;

While their bright tints are glowing,

Work for daylight flies.

Work till the last beam fadeth,

Fadeth to shine no more;

Work while the night is dark’ning,

When man’s work is o’er.
