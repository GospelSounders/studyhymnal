# 1

O who is this that cometh

From Edom's crimson plain,

With wounded side, with garments dyed?

O tell me now thy name.

"I that saw thy soul's distress,

A ransom gave;

I that speak in righteousness,

Mighty to save."



Refrain:

Mighty to save,

Mighty to save,

Mighty to save;

Lord, I trust thy wondrous love,

Mighty to save.



# 2

O why is thine apparel

With reeking gore all dyed,

Like them that tread the winepress red?

O why this bloody tide?

I the wine-press trod alone, 

"Neath dark'ning skies;

Of the people there was none

Mighty to save."  [Chorus]



# 3

O bleeding Lamb, my Saviour!

How could'st thou bear this shame?

"With mercy fraught, mine own arm brought

Salvation in my name;

I the bloody fight have won,

Conquer'd the grave,

Now the year of joy has come,

Mighty to save."  [Chorus]
