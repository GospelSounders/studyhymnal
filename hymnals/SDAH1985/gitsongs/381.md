# 1

Holy Sabbath day of rest,

By our Master richly blest,

God created and divine,

Set aside for holy time.



# Refrain

Yes, the holy Sabbath rest,

By our God divinely blest,

It to us a sign shall be

Throughout all eternity.



# 2

Seek not pleasures of this earth,

With its folly, noise, and mirth,

There are better things in store,

Over on the other shore.



# 3

As the Sabbath draweth on

Friday eve at set of sun,

Christian household then should meet,

Sing and pray at Jesus’feet.



# 4

Asking Him for saving grace,

Also vict’ry in the race,

And to help us by His pow’r,

To keep holy every hour.
