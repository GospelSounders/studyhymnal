# 1

Jesus loves me! this I know,

For the Bible tells me so;

Little ones to Him belong

They are weak but He is strong



# Refrain

Yes, Jesus loves me!

Yes, Jesus loves me!

Yes, Jesus loves me!

The Bible tells me so.



# 2

Jesus loves me! He wo died

Heaven’s gate to open wide:

He will wash away my sin,

Let His little child come in.



# 3

Jesus, take this heart of mine,

Make it pure and wholly thine;

On the coross You died for me,

I will love and live for Thee.
