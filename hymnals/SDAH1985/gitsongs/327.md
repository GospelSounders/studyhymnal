I’d rather be His than have riches untold;

I’d rather have Jesus than houses or land;

I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced hand:

I’d rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.

I’d rather have Jesus than world-wide fame;

I’d rather be true to His holy name:

I’d rather have Jesus and let Him lead:
