# 1

God be with you till we meet again;

By his counsels guide, uphold you,

With his sheep securely fold you;

God be with you till we meet again.



Refrain:

Till we meet, till we meet,

Till we meet at Jesus' feet,

Till we meet, till we meet,

God be with you till we meet again.



# 2

God be with you till we meet again;

'Neath his wings protecting hide you,

Daily manna still provide you;

God be with you till we meet again.  [Refrain]



# 3

God be with you till we meet again;

When life's perils thick confound you,

Put his arms unfailing round you;

God be with you till we meet again.  [Refrain]



# 4

God be with you till we meet again;

Keep love's banner floating o'er you,

Smile death's threat'ning wave before you;

God be with you till we meet again.  [Refrain]
