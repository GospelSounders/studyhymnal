# 1

Safely through another week

God has brought us on our way;

Let us now a blessing seek,

Waiting in His courts today;

Day of all the week the best,

Emblem of eternal rest:

Day of all the week the best,

Emblem of eternal rest.



# 2

While we seek supplies of grace,

Thro’ the dear Redeemer’s name,

Show Thy reconciling face;

Take away the sin and shame:

From our worldly cares set free,

May we rest this day in Thee:

From our worldly cares set free,

May we rest this day in Thee.



# 3

When the more shall bid us rise,

May we feel Thy presence near;

May Thy glory meet our eyes,

While we in Thy house appear:

Here afford us, Lord, a taste

Of our everlasting feast:

Here afford us, Lord, a taste

Of our everlasting feast.



# 4

May the gospel’s joyful sound

Conquer sinners, comfort saints;

Make the fruits of grace abound,

Bring relief to all complaints:

Thus may all our Sabbaths be,

Till we we rise to reign with Thee.

Thus may all our Sabbaths be,

Till we we rise to reign with Thee.
