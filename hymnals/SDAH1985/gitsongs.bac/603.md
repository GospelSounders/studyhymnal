# 1

Christian, seek not yet repose, Cast thy dreams of ease away;

Thou aret in teh midst of foes; Watch and pray!



# 2

Gird thy heavenly armor on, Wear it ever, night and day;

Ambushed lies the evil one; Watch and pray!



# 3

Hear the victors who o’ercame; Still they mark each warrior’s way;

All with one sweet voice exclaim: “Watch and pray!”



# 4

Hear, above all, hear thy Lord, Him thou lovest to obey;

Hide within thy heart His word; “Watch and pray!”



# 5

Watch, as if on that alone Hung the issue of teh day;

Pray that help may be send down; Watch and pray!
