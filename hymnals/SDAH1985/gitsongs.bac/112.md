Let us with a gladsome mind

Praise the Lord, for He is kind:

For His mercies shall endure,

Ever faithful, ever sure.

He, with all commanding might,

Filled the new made world with light:

For His mercies shall endure,

Ever faithful, ever sure.



# 3

All things living He does feed;

His full hand supplies their need:

For His mercies shall endure,

Ever faithful, ever sure.

Let us then with gladsome mind

Praise the Lord, for He is kind:

For His mercies shall endure,

Ever faithful, ever sure.
