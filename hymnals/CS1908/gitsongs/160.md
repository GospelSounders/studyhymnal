# 1

O, for a closer walk with God!

A calm and heav'nly frame,

A light to shine upon the road

That leads me to the Lamb.



# 2

Return, O holy Dove!  return,

Sweet Messenger of rest;

I hate the sins that made thee mourn,

And drove thee from my breast.



# 3

What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!  

How sweet their mem'ry still!

But they have left an aching void

The world can never fill.



# 4

The dearest idol I have known,

Whate'er that idol be,

Help me to tear it from thy throne,

And worship only thee.
