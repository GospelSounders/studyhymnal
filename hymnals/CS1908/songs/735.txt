735 â€“ Guard Thy Children


1
Gracious Father, guard thy children
From the foe's destructive pow'r;
Save O save them, Lord, from falling
In this dark and trying hour.
Thou wilt surely prove thy people,
All our graces must be tried; 
But thy word illumes our pathway,
And in God we still confide.

2
 We are in the time of waiting;
Soon we shall behold our Lord,
Wafted far away from sorrow,
To receive our rich reward.
Keep us, Lord, till thine appearing,
Pure, unspotted from the world;
Let thy Holy Spirit cheer us
Till thy banner is unfurled.
