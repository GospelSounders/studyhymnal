# Refrain

Now is born the divine Christ child,

Play the musette, play the tuneful oboe,

Now is born the divine Christ child,

Sing we all and rejoice this day.



# 1

He was born in a stable bare,

On bed of straw how He sleeps so soundly,

He was born in a stable bare,

Let us worship and to Him bow.



# 2

Ages long since are past and gone,

When the wise men foretold His coming,

Ages long since are past and gone,

When the wise men foretold His birth.
