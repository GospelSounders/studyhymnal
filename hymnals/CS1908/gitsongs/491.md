# 1

Saviour, more than life to me,

I am clinging, clinging close to Thee;

Let Thy precious blood applied,

Keep me ever, ever near Thy side.



Refrain:

Ev'ry day, ev'ry hour,

Let me feel Thy cleansing pow'r

May Thy tender love to me 

Bind me closer, closer, Lord to Thee.



# 2

Thro' this changing world below,

Lead me gently, gently as I go,

Trusting Thee, I cannot stray,

I can never, never lose my way. [Refrain]



# 3

I would love Thee more and more,

Till this fleeting, fleeting life is o'er,

Till my soul is lost in love 

In a brighter, brighter world above.  [Refrain]
