033 â€“ Building for Eternity


1
We are building in sorrow or joy
A temple the world may not see,
Which time cannot mar nor destroy:
We build for eternity.

Chorus:
We are building, ev'ry day,
A temple the world may not see;
Building, building ev'ry day,
Building for eternity!

2
Ev'ry tho't that we've ever had,
Its own little place has fill'd;
Ev'ry deed we have done, good or bad,
Is a stone in the temple we build.  [Chorus]

3
Ev'ry word that so lightly falls,
Giving some heart joy or pain,
Will shine in our temple wall,
Or ever its beauty stain.  [Chorus]

4
Are you building for God alone?
Are you building in faith and love,
A temple the Father will own,
In the city of light above?  [Chorus]
