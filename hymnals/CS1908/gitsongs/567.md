# 1

'Tis love that makes us happy,

'Tis love that smooths the way;

It helps us "mind," it makes us kind

To others ev'ry day.



Refrain:

God is love; we're his little children.

God is love; we would be like him.

'Tis love that makes us happy,

'Tis love that smooths the way;

It helps us "mind," it makes us kind

To others ev'ry day.



# 2

This world is full of sorrow,

Of sickness, death, and sin;

With loving heart we'll do our part,

And try some soul to win.  [Refrain]



# 3

And when this life is over,

And we are called above,

Our song shall be, eternally,

Of Jesus and his love.  [Refrain]
