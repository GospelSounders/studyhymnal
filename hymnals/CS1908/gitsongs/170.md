170 â€“ Take My Heart


1
Take my heart, O Father, take it!
Make and keep it all Thine own;
Let Thy Spirit melt and break it,
This proud heart of sin and stone.

2
Father, make it pure and lowly,
Fond of peace and far from strife;
Turning from the paths unholy,
Of this vain and sinful life.

3
Ever let Thy race surround me,
Strengthen me with pow'r divine;
By Thy cords of love that bound me,
Make me to be wholly Thine.

4
May the blood of Jesus heal me,
And my sins be all forgiv'n;
Holy Spirit, take and seal me, 
Guide me in the path to heav'n.
