# 1

Saved to serve in any station,

Saved to make his goodness known;

Saved to sing His great salvation,

Saved to live for Him alone.



Chorus:

Saved to serve; no reserve;

Saved to wear His yoke alone;

Work and praise, all my days,

Here and round His glorious throne.



# 2

Saved to show by loving kindness

That His love is full and free;

Saved to lead from error's blindness

With a tender sympathy.  [Chorus]



# 3

Saved to lift my lowest brothers,

As the Highest lifted me;

Crucified with Him, that others

May have immortality.  [Chorus]
