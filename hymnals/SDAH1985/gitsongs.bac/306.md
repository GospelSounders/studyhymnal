# 1

I am thine, O Lord, I have heard thy voice,

and it told thy love to me;

but I long to rise in the arms of faith

and be closer drawn to thee.



# Refrain

Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

to the cross where thou hast died.

Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

to thy precious, bleeding side.



# 2

Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord,

by the power of grace divine;

let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,

and my will be lost in thine.



# 3

O the pure delight of a single hour

that before thy throne I spend,

when I kneel in prayer, and with thee, my God,

I commune as friend with friend!
