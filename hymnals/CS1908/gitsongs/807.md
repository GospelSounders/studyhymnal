1.

Day by day the manna fell;

O to learn this lesson well!

Still by constant mercy fed,

Give me, Lord, our daily bread.



2.

"Day by day," the promise reads

Daily strength for daily needs;

Cast foreboding fears away,

Take the manna of today.



3.

Lord, our times are in thy hand;

All our sanguine hopes have plann'd

To thy wisdom we resign,

And would mold our wills to thine.



4.

Thou our daily task shalt give;

Day by day to thee we live;

So shall added years fulfil

Not our own, our Father's will.
