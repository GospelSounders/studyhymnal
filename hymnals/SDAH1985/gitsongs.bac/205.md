# 1

The golden morning is fast approaching;

Jesus soon will come

To take his faithful and happy children

to their promised home



# Refrain

O, we see the gleams of the golden morning

piercing thro’ this night of gloom!

O, see the gleams of the golden morning

that will burst the tomb.



# 2

The gospel summons will soon be carried

to the nations round;

The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry

and the trumpet sound.



# 3

Attended by all the shining angels,

Down the flaming sky

the Judge will come, and will take his people

where they will not die.



# 4

The lov’d of earth who have long been parted,

Meet in that glad day;

The tears of those who are broken hearted

shall be wiped away.
