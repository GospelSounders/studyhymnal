# 1

O spotless Lamb!  I come to thee,

No longer can I from thee stay;

Break ev'ry chain, now set me free,

Take all my sin away.



Chorus:

Take all my sin away,

Take all my sin away;

O spotless Lamb, I come to thee;    

Take all my sin away.



# 2

Weary I am of inbred sin,

Oh, wilt thou not my soul release?

Enter and speak me pure within,

Give me thy perfect peace.  [Chorus]



# 3

I plunge beneath thy precious blood,

My hand in faith takes hold of thee;

Thy promises just now I claim;

Thou art enough for me.   



Chorus:

Take all my sin away,

Take all my sin away;

O spotless Lamb, I come to thee;

He takes my sin away.
