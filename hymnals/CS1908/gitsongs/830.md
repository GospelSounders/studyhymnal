1.

At first I prayed for light:

Could I but see the way,

How gladly, swiftly would I walk

To everlasting day!



2.

And next I prayed for strength:

That I might tread the road

With firm, unfalt'ring, feet and win

The heaven's serene abode.



3.

And then I asked for faith:

Could I but trust my God,

I'd live unfolded in His peace,

Tho' foes were all abroad.



4.

But now I pray for love:

Deep love to God and man;

A living love that will not fail,

However dark His plan.



5.

And light and strength and faith

Are opening everywhere!

God waited patiently until

I prayed the larger pray'r.
