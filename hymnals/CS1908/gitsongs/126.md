# 1

Jesus, let thy pitying eye

Call back a wand'ring sheep;

False to thee, like Peter, I

Would fain like Peter, weep.

Speak the reconciling word,

And let thy mercy melt me down;

Turn, and look upon me, Lord,

And break my heart of stone.



# 2

Saviour, Prince, enthroned above,

Repentance to impart,

Give me, thro' thy dying love,

The humble, contrite heart;

Give what I have long implor'd,

A portion of thy grief unknown;

Turn, and look upon me, Lord,

And break my heart of stone.



# 3

For thine own compassion's sake,

The gracious wonder show;

Cast my sins behind thy back,

And wash me white as snow:

If thy pity now is stirr'd,

If now I do myself bemoan,

Turn, and look upon me, Lord,

And break my heart of stone.



# 4

Clothe me with thy holiness,

Thy meek humility;

Put on me thy glorious dress

Endue my soul with thee:

Let thine image be restor'd,

Thy name and nature let me prove;

Fill me with thy fulness, Lord,

And perfect me in love.
