1.

O how I long to see that day

When the redeemed shall come

To Zion, clad in white array

Their blissful, happy home.



Chorus:

O bear me on, bear me on

To Mount Zion;

O bear me on to that city of love

Where saints shall ever dwell.



2.

I'll hear the alleluias roll

From the unnumbered throng,

And with a heaven-enraptured soul

I'll join redemption's song.  [Chorus]



3.

All hail!  the morn of glory's nigh

The pilgrim longs to see

That dries the tear from every eye

Creation's jubilee.  [Chorus]
