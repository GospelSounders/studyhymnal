# 1

Jesus, Savior, pilot me

over life’s tempestuous sea;

unknown waves before me roll,

hiding rock and treacherous shoal.

Chart and compass come from thee;

Jesus, Savior, pilot me.



# 2

As a mother stills her child,

thou canst hush the ocean wild;

boisterous waves obey thy will,

when thou sayest to them, “Be still!”

Wondrous sovreign of the sea,

Jesus, Savior, pilot me.



# 3

When at last I near the shore,

and the fearful breakers roar

‘twixt me and the peaceful rest,

then, while leaning on thy breast,

may I hear thee say to me,

“Fear not, I will pilot thee.
