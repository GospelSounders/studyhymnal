449 â€“ The Thought of Thee


1
Jesus, the very thought of thee,
With sweetness fills the breast;
But sweeter far thy face to see,
And in thy presence rest.

2
No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
Nor can the mem'ry find
A sweeter sound than Jesus' name,
The Saviour of mankind.

3
O hope of ev'ry contrite heart!
O joy of all the meek!
To those who fall, how kind thou art!
How good to those who seek!
