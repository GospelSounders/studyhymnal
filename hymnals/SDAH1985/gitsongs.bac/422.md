# 1

Come, we that love the Lord,

And let our joys be known;

Join in a song with sweet accord,

Join in a song with sweet accord,

And thus surround the throne,

And thus surround the throne.



# Refrain

We’re marching to Zion,

Beautiful, beautiful Zion;

We’re marching upward to Zion,

The beautiful city of God.



# 2

Let those refuse to sing

Who never knew our God;

But children of the heav’nly King,

But children of the heav’nly King

May speak their joys abroad,

May speak their joys abroad.



# 3

The hill of Zion yields

A thousand sacred sweets

Before we reach the heav’nly fields,

Before we reach the heav’nly fields

Or walk the golden streets,

Or walk the golden streets.



# 4

Then let our songs abound

And ev’ry tear be dry;

We’re marching thru Immanuel’s ground,

We’re marching thru Immanuel’s ground

To fairer worlds on high,

To fairer worlds on high.
