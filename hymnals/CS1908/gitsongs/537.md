1"Go

ye into all the world,

And preach the gospel to ev'ry creature,"

Let my banner be unfurled,

With pen, and song, and the living teacher.



Chorus:

"Even unto the end,

Even unto the end;"

"Lo, I am with you alway,

Even unto the end."



# 2

Millions bless'd with gospel light,

Yet need the gladness of sins forgiven;

Millions, cursed with heathen night,

Yet long to know of the Way to heaven.  [Chorus]



# 3

Stand not idle all the day,

Because no man hath declared thy wages;

Work on, love demands no pay,

'Tis all set down in the heav'nly pages.  [Chorus]



# 4

All things on the altar lay,

Let Calvry's cross be thy only glory;

Cast all selfish fear away,

Begin just now telling love's sweet story.  [Chorus]
