# 1

Heavenly Father, bless us now;

At the cross of Christ we bow;

Take our guilt and grief away;

Hear and heal us now, we pray.



# 2

Now, O Lord, this very hour,

Send Thy grace and show Thy power;

While we rest upon Thy word,

Come, and bless us now, O Lord!



# 3

Mercy now, O Lord, we plead

In this hour of utter need;

Turn us not away unblest;

Calm our anguish into rest.



# 4

O Thou loving, blessed One,

Rising oér us like the sun,

Light and life art Thou within:

Savior, Thou, from every sin!
