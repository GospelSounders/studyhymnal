# 1

God is my strong salvation,

What foe have I to fear?

In darkness and temptation,

My Light, my Help, is near:

Though hosts encamp around me,

Firm in the fight I stand;

What terror can confound me,

With God at my right hand?



# 2

Place on the reliance;

My soul with courage wait;

His truth be thine affiance,

When faint and desolate.

His might thy heart shall strengthen,

His love thy joy increase;

Mercy thy days shall lengthen;

The Lord will give thee peace.
