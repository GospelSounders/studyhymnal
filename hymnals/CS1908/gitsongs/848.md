1.

We shall meet beyond the river,

By and by, by and by;

And the darkness shall be over,

By and by, by and by;

With the toilsome journey done,

And the glorious battle won,

We shall shine forth as the sun, 

By and by, by and by.



2.

We shall strike the harps of glory,

By and by, by and by;

We shall sing redemption's story, 

By and by, by and by;

And the strains forevermore

Shall resound in sweetness o'er

Yonder everlasting shore,

By and by, by and by.



3.

We shall see and be like Jesus,

By and by, by and by;

Who a crown of life will give us,

By and by, by and by;

And the angels who fulfil

All the mandates of His will

Shall attend, and love us still,

By and by, by and by.



4.

There our tears shall all cease flowing,

By and by, by and by;

And with sweetest rapture knowing,

By and by, by and by,

All the loved ones, parted long,

We with shoutings shall rejoin

In that land of life and song,

By and by, by and by.
