159 â€“ Shall Our Cheeks Be Dry?


1
Did Christ o'er sinners weep?
And shall our cheeks be dry?
Let floods of penitential grief
Burst forth from ev'ry eye.

2
The Son of God in tears,
The wond'ring angels see!
Be thou astonished, O my soul!
He shed those tears for thee.

3
He wept; shall we not weep?
He died; shall we not die?
He rose; shall we not rise from sleep,
To reign with him on high?
