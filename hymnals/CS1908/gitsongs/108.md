# 1

My faith looks up to thee,

Thou Lamb of Calvary,

Saviour divine!

Now hear me while I pray,

Take all my guilt away,

O, let me from this day

Be wholly thine!



# 2

May thy rich grace impart

Strength to my fainting heart,

My zeal inspire;

As thou hast died for me,

O, may my love to thee,

Pure, warm, and changeless be,

A living fire!



# 3

While life's dark maze I tread,

And griefs around me spread,

Be thou my guide;

Bid darkness turn to day,

Wipe sorrow's tears away,

Nor let me ever stray

From thee aside.
