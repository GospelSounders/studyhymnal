# Refrain

All things bright and beautiful

All creatures great and small

All things wise and wonderful

The Lord God made them all.



# 1

Each little flow’r that opens

Each little bird that sings

He made their glowing colours

He made their tiny wings.



# 2

The purple-headed mountain

The river running by

The sunset and the morning

That brighten up the sky.



# 3

The cold wind in the winter

The pleasant summer sun

The ripe fruits in the garden

He made them, every one.



# 4

He gave us eyes to see them

And lips that we might tell

How great is God Almighty

Who has made all things well.
