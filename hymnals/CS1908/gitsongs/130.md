# 1

Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,

Which before the cross we spend;

Life and health and peace possessing

From the sinner's dying Friend.



# 2

Truly blessed is this station,

Low before His cross to lie,

While we see divine compassion

Beaming in His gracious eye.



# 3

Here we feel our sins forgiven,

While upon the Lamb we gaze;

And our tho'ts are all of heaven,

And our lips o'erflow with praise.
