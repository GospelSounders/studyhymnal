# 1

Jesus calls us o’er the tumult

of our life’s wild, restless sea;

day by day his sweet voice soundeth,

saying, “Christian, follow me!”



# 2

Jesus calls us from the worship

of the vain world’s golden store,

from each idol that would keep us,

saying, “Christian, love me more!”



# 3

In our joys and in our sorrows,

days of toil and hours of ease,

still he calls, in cares and pleasures,

“Christian, love me more than these!”



# 4

Jesus calls us! By thy mercies,

Savior, may we hear thy call,

give our hearts to thine obedience,

serve and love thee best of all.
