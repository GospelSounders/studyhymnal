# 1

Each little flow'r that opens,

Each little bird that sings;

God made their glowing colors,

He made their tiny wings;



# 2

The purple-headed mountain,

The river running by,

The sunset and the morning,

That brighten up the sky;



# 3

The cold wind in the winter,

The pleasant summer sun,

The ripe fruits in the garden,

God made them ev'ry one.



# 4

He gave us eyes to see them,

And lips that we might tell

How great is God Almighty,

Who has made all things well.
