# 1

Carry the joyful tidings

To every land and sea;

Banish the heart dividings,

Brothers should brothers be;

Christ died for all the nations,

"One flesh and blood," saith he;

There are no tribes or stations;

One in the Lord are we.



# 2

God who hath lent his talents,

Bids us his service choose;

God who hath lent his riches,

Bids us in kindness use;

God who hath freedom given,

Calls us to make it known;

He is preparing heaven

Not for ourselves alone.



# 3

Souls on the Orient mountains,

Souls in the Northern snows,

Souls by the Southern fountains

Souls where the sunset glows;

Souls out of Christ the Saviour;

O for a Church of love,

Bearing the priceless favor,

Pointing the lost above!
