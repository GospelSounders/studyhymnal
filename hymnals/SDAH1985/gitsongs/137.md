# 1

We three kings of Orient are;

Bearing gifts we traverse afar

Field and fountain, moor and mountain,

Following yonder star.



# Refrain

O star of wonder, star of night,

Star with royal beauty bright,

Westward leading, still proceeding,

Guide us to Thy perfect light.



# 2

Born a King on Bethlehem’s plain,

Gold I bring to crown Him again,

King forever, ceasing never

Over us all to reign.



# 3

Frankincense to offer have I;

Incense owns a Deity nigh;

Prayer and praising all men raising,

Worship Him, God on high.



# 4

Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume

Breathes a life of gathering gloom:

Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,

Sealed in the stonecold tomb.



# 5

Glorious now behold Him arise,

King and God and sacrifice;

Alleluia, Alleluia!

Sounds through the earth and skies.
