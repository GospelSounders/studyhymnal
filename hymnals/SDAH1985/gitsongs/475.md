# 1

There is a balm in Gilead

To make the wounded whole;

There is a balm in Gilead

To heal the sin-sick soul.



# 2

Sometimes I feel discouraged,

And think my work’s in vain,

But then the Holy Spirit

Revives my soul again.



# 3

If you can not preach like Peter,

If you can not pray like Paul,

You can tell the love of Jesus,

And say He died for all.
