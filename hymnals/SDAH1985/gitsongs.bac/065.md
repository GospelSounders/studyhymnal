# 1

God be with you till we meet again;

By His counsels guide, uphold you,

With His sheep securely fold you;

God be with you till we meet again.



# Refrain

Till we meet, till we meet,

Till we meet at Jesus’ feet;

Till we meet, till we meet,

God be with you till we meet again.



# 2

God be with you till we meet again;

‘Neath His wings securely hide you;

Daily manna still provide you;

God be with you till we meet again.



# 3

God be with you till we meet again;

When life’s perils thick confound you;

Put His arms unfailing round you;

God be with you till we meet again.



# 4

God be with you till we meet again;

Keep love’s banner floating over you,

Strike death’s threatening wave before you;

God be with you till we meet again.
