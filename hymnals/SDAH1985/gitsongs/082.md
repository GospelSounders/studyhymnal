# 1

Before Jehovah’s awful throne,

Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;

Know that the Lord is God alone;

He can create, and He destroy.



# 2

His sovereign power, without our aid,

Made us of clay, and formed us men;

and when like wandering sheep we strayed,

He brought us to His fold again.



# 3

We’ll crowd His gates with thankful songs,

High as the heavens our voices raise;

And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,

Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.



# 4

Wide as the world is His command,

Vast as Eternity His love;

Firm as a rock His truth shall stand,

When rolling years shall cease to move.
