# 1

Encamped along the hills of light,

Ye Christian soldiers, rise,

And press the battle ere the night

Shall veil the glowing skies;

Against the foe in vales below,

Let all our strength be hurled;

Faith is the victory, we know,

That overcomes the world.



Chorus:

Faith is the victory!

Faith is the victory;

Oh, glorious victory,

That overcomes the world.



# 2

His banner over us is love,

Our sword the word of God;

We tread the road the saints above

With shouts of triumph trod;

By faith they, like a whirlwind's breath,

Swept on o'er ev'ry field;

The faith by which they conquered Death

Is still our shining shield.  [Chorus]



# 3

On ev'ry hand the foe we find

Drawn up in dread array;

Let tents of ease be left behind,

And onward to the fray;

Salvation's helmet on each head,

With truth all girt about,

The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,

And echo with our shout.  [Chorus]



# 4

To him that overcomes the foe,

White raiment shall be giv'n;

Before the angels he shall know

His name confessed in heav'n;

Then onward from the hills of light,

Our hearts with love aflame;

We'll vanquish all the hosts of night,

In Jesus' conqu'ring name.  [Chorus]
