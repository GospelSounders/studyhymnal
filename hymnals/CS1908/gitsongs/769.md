1.

The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;

He makes me down to lie

In pastures green; he leadeth me

The quiet waters by.



2.

My soul He doth restore again;

And me to walk doth make

Within the paths of righteousness,

Ev'n for his own name's sake.



3.

Yea, tho' I walk in death's dark vale,

Yet will I fear none ill;

For thou art with me; and thy rod

And staff do comfort still.
