# 1

Now thank we all our God

with heart and hands and voices,

who wondrous things hath done,

in whom His world rejoices;

Who, from our mothers’ arms

hath blessed us on our way

with countless gifts of love,

and still is ours today.



# 2

O may this bounteous God

through all our life be near us,

with ever joyful hearts

and blessed peace to cheer us;

and keep us still in grace,

and guide us when perplexed;

and free us from all ills,

in this world and the next.



# 3

All praise and thanks to God

the Father now be given;

the Son, and Him who reigns

with them in highest heaven;

the one eternal God,

whom earth and heaven adore;

for thus it was, is now,

and shall be evermore.
