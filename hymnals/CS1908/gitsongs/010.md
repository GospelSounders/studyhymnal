# 1

Like wand'ring sheep o'er mountains cold,

Since all have gone astray;

To "Life" and peace within the fold,

How may I find the way?



Chorus:

I am the way, the truth, and the life:

No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.

I am the way, I am the way, 

I am the way, the truth, and the life;

No man cometh unto the Father but by me.



# 2

Bewildered oft with doubt and care,

To God I fain would go;

While many cry "Lo here!  lo there!"

The Truth how may I know?  [Chorus]



# 3

To Christ the Way, the Truth, the Life,

I come, no more to roam;

He'll guide me to my "Father's house,

To my eternal home.  [Chorus]
