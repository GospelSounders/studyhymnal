# 1

Drifting away from the Saviour,

Casting reproach on the Lord;

Drifting away from His temple,

Heeding no longer His word.



Refrain:

Drifting away, drifting away,

Drifting away from the Saviour,

Drifting, still drifting away.



# 2

Drifting away from the Saviour,

Slighting and grieving His love;

Drifting away from the mansions

He is preparing above.  [Refrain]



# 3

Drifting away from the Saviour, 

Lonely and helpless thou art;

Drifting away from His people,

Ever so dear to His heart.  [Refrain]



# 4

Drifting away from the Saviour,

He who has showed you the way;

Drifting away from His teaching,

Farther and farther each day.  [Refrain]



# 5

Drifting away from the Saviour,

Still He is mindful of thee.

Come unto Him and believing,

Pardon'd thro' grace thou shalt be.  [Refrain]
