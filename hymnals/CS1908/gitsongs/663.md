# 1

Nearer, my God, to thee,

Nearer to thee!

E'en tho' it be a cross

That raiseth me!

Still all my song shall be,

Nearer, my God, to thee,

Nearer, my God, to thee, 

Nearer to thee.



# 2

Tho' like a wanderer,

Daylight all gone,

Darkness be over me,

My rest a stone;

Yet in my dreams I'd be

Nearer, my God, to thee,

Nearer, my God, to thee,

Nearer to thee.



# 3

There let the way appear,

Steps up to heav'n,

All that thou sendest me,

In mercy giv'n;

Angels to beckon me

Nearer, my God, to thee,

Nearer, my God, to thee,

Nearer to thee.



# 4

Then, with my waking tho'ts

Bright with thy praise,

Out of my stony griefs

Bethel I'll raise;

So by my woes to be

Nearer, my God, to thee,

Nearer, my God, to thee,

Nearer to thee.



# 5

Or if, on joyful wing

Cleaving the sky,

Sun, moon, and stars forgot,

Upward I fly,

Still all my song shall be,

Nearer, my God, to thee,

Nearer, my God, to thee,

Near to thee.
