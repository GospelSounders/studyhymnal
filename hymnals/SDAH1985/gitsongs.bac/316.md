# 1

Live out Thy life within me, O Jesus, King of kings!

Be Thou Thyself the answer To all my questionings;

Live out Thy life within me, In all things have Thy way!

I, the transparent medium Thy glory to display.



# 2

The temple has been yielded, And purified of sin;

Let Thy Shekinah glory Now shine forth from within,

And all the earth keep silence, The body henceforth be

Thy silent, gentle servant, Moved only as by Thee.



# 3

Its members every moment Held subject to Thy call,

Ready to have Thee use them, Or not be used at all;

Held without restless longing, Or strain, or stress, or fret

Or chafings at Thy dealings, Or thoughts of vain regret.



# 4

But restful, calm, and pliant, From bend and bias free,

Awaiting Thy decision, When Thou hast need of me.

Live out Thy life within me, O Jesus, King of kings!

Be Thou the glorious answer To all my questionings.
