# 1

Sowing the seed by the daylight fair,

Sowing the seed by the noonday glare,

Sowing the seed by the fading light,

Sowing the seed in the solemn night.



Chorus:

Sown in the darkness or sown in the light,

Sown in our weakness or sown in our might;

Gathered in time or eternity,

Sure, ah!  sure will the harvest be.



# 2

Sowing the seed by the wayside high,

Sowing the seed on the rocks to die,

Sowing the seed where the thorns will spoil,

Sowing the seed in the fertile soil.  [Chorus]



# 3

Sowing the seed of a ling'ring pain,

Sowing the seed of a maddened brain,

Sowing the seed of a tarnished name,

Sowing the seed of eternal shame.  [Chorus]



# 4

Sowing the seed with an aching heart,

Sowing the seed while the teardrops start,

Sowing in hope till the reapers come

Gladly to gather the harvest home.  [Chorus]
