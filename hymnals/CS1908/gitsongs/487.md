# 1

I cease to sing of sweet tomorrow,

With selfish thought to be away;

There is a holier balm for sorrow,

I find in Christ a sweet to-day.



Refrain:

A risen Christ, a living Saviour,

Not in the tomb where once he lay.

Whene'er I tell his loving favor,

Sweet by and by is ev'ry day.



# 2

I am so happy when I'm telling

How great his pow'r, how great his love;

Were there no praise where God is dwelling,

It would be pain to live above.  [Refrain]



# 3

If but to gain a home in glory

The Saviour trod this earth alone,

There ne'er had been a gospel story,

He ne'er had left his royal throne.  [Refrain]



# 4

His love is life, his love is heaven

Eternal life, eternal bliss;

Accept it freely, be forgiven,

And taste the future world in this.  [Refrain]
