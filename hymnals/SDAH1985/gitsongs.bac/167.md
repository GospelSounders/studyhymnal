# 1

Alleluia! sing to Jesus! His the scepter, His the throne.

Alleluia! His the triumph, His the victory alone.

Hark! the songs of peaceful Zion thunder like a mighty flood.

Jesus out of every nation has redeemed us by His blood.



# 2

Alleluia! not as orphans are we left in sorrow now;

Alleluia! He is near us, faith believes, nor questions how;

Though the cloud from sight received Him when the forty days were o’er

Shall our hearts forget His promise, “I am with you evermore”?



# 3

Alleluia! bread of angels, Thou on earth our food, our stay;

Alleluia! here the sinful flee to Thee from day to day:

Intercessor, Friend of sinners, Earth’s Redeemer, plead for me,

Where the songs of all the sinless sweep across the crystal sea.
