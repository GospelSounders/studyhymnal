# 1

O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,

On whom in affliction I call,

My comfort by day and my song in the night,

My hope, my salvation, my all!



# 2

His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,

Is heard through the shadows of death;

The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,

The air is perfumed with His breath.



# 3

His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,

To water the gardens of grace;

From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,

And bask in the smiles of His face.



# 4

He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,

And myriads wait for His word;

He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,

Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.
