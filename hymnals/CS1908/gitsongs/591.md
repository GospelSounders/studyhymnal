# 1

Father, hear the prayer we offer!

Not for ease that prayer shall be,

But for strength that we may ever

Live our lives courageously.



# 2

Not forever by still waters

Would we idly, quiet stay,

But would smite the living fountains

From the rocks along our way.



# 3

Be our strength in hours of weakness,

In our wand'rings be our guide;

Thro' endeavor, hardships, danger,

Father, be Thou at our side.



# 4

Ours to sow the seed in sorrow,

Thine to bid it spring and grow;

And the golden days of autumn

Will a precious harvest show.
