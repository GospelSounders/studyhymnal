405 â€“ Consecrated Childhood 


1
By cool Siloam's shady rill
How fair the lily grows!
How sweet the breath, beneath the hill,
Of Sharon's dewy rose!

2
Lo, such the child whose early feet
The paths of peace have trod,
Whose secret heart, with influence sweet,
Is upward drawn to God.

3
Dependent on thy bounteous breath,
We seek thy grace alone
In childhood, manhood, age, and death,
To keep us still thine own.
