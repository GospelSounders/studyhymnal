# 1

Look for the way-marks as you journey on,

Look for the way-marks, passing one by one;

Down thro' the ages, past the kingdoms four,

Where are we standing?

Look the way-marks o'er.



Chorus:

Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,

Down thro' the ages, past the kingdoms four.

Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic waymarks;

The journey's almost o'er.



# 2

First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,

Then Medo Persia's banners were unfurled;

And after Greece held universal sway,

Rome seized the scepter,

Where are we today?  [Chorus]



# 3

Down in the feet of iron and of clay,

Weak and divided, soon to pass away;

What will the next great, glorious drama be?

Christ and his coming, 

And eternity.  [Chorus]
