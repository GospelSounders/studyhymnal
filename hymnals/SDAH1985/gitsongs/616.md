# 1

Soldiers of Christ,arise,

And put your armor on,

Strong in the strength which God supplies

Through His eternal Son

Strong in the Lord of hosts,

And in His mighty power,

Who in the strength of Jesus trusts

Is more than conqueror.



# 2

Stand then in His great might,

With all His strength endued,

But take, to arm you for the fight,

The panoply of God;

That, having all things done,

And all your conflicts passed,

Ye may o’ercome through Christ alone,

And stand entire at last.



# 3

From strength to strength go on,

Wrestle and fight and pray,

Tread all the powers of darkness down

And win the well-fought day.

Still let the Spirit cry

In all His soldiers, “Come!”

Till Christ the Lord who reigns on high

Shall take the conquerors home.
