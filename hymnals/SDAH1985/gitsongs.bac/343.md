# 1

I will sing of my Redeemer,

And His wondrous love to me;

On the cruel cross He suffered,

From the curse to set me free.



# Refrain

Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,

With His blood, He purchased me.

On the cross, He sealed my pardon,

Paid the debt, and made me free.



# 2

I will tell the wondrous story,

How my lost estate to save,

In His boundless love and mercy,

He the ransom freely gave.



# 3

I will sing of my Redeemer,

And His heavenly love to me;

He from death to life hath brought me,

Son of God with Him to be.
