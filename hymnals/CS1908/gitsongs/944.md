1.

Meet again when time is o'er,

Meet again to part no more;

How it cheers the drooping heart.

When from friend we're called to part!



2.

Meet again where endless joy

We shall taste without alloy;

Meet where songs shall ne'er grow old,

Sweetly tuned to harps of gold.



3.

Meet again, how passing sweet,

Friends long lost again to meet!

Careworn souls, by temptest driv'n,

O how sweet to meet in heav'n!
