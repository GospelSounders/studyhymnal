# 1

My life, my love, I give to thee,

Thou Lamb of God, who died for me;

O, may I ever faithful be,

My Saviour and my God!



Chorus:

I'll live for him who died for me;

How happy then my life shall be!

I'll live for him who died for me,

My Saviour and my God!



# 2

I now believe thou dost receive,

For thou hast died that I might live,

And now henceforth I'll trust in thee,

My Saviour and my God!  [Chorus]



# 3

O thou who died on Calvary,

To save my soul and make me free,

I consecrate my life to thee,

My Saviour and my God!  [Chorus]
