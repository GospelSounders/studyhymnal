# 1

Chide mildly the erring,

Kind language endears,

Grief follows the sinful,

Add not to their tears;

Avoid with reproaches

Fresh pain to bestow;

The heart that is stricken

Needs never a blow.



# 2

Chide mildly the erring,

Jeer not at their fall;

If strength be but human,

How feeble were all!

What marvel that footsteps

Should wander away,

When tempests so darken

Life's wearisome way?



# 3

Chide mildly the erring,

Entreat them with care;

Their natures are mortal,

They need not despair.

We all have some frailty,

We all are unwise;

The grace which redeems us

Must come from the skies.
