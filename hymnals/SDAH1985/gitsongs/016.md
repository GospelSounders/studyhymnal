# 1

All people that on earth do dwell,

sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.

Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell;

come ye before him and rejoice.



# 2

Know that the Lord is God indeed;

without our aid he did us make;

we are his folk, he doth us feed,

and for his sheep he doth us take.



# 3

O enter then his gates with praise;

approach with joy his courts unto;

praise, laud, and bless his name always,

for it is seemly so to do.



# 4

For why! the Lord our God is good;

his mercy is forever sure;

his truth at all times firmly stood,

and shall from age to age endure.
