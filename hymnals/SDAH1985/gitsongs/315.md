# 1

O for a closer walk with God,

A calm and heavenly frame,

A light to shine upon the road

That leads me to the Lamb!



# 2

Return, O holy Dove, return,

Sweet messenger of rest!

I hate the sins that made Thee mourn

And drove Thee from my breast.



# 3

What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!

How sweet their memory still!

But they have left an aching void

The world can never fill.



# 4

The dearest idol I have known,

What-e’er that idol be,

Help me to tear it from Thy throne,

And worship only Thee.
