# 1

God sees the little sparrow fall

It meets his tender view;

If God so loves the little birds,

I know he loves me, too.



Chorus:

He loves me, too, he loves me, too,

I know he loves me, too;

Because he loves the little things, 

I know he loves me, too.



# 2

He paints the lily of the field,

Perfumes each lily bell;

If he so loves the little flow'rs,

I know he loves me well.  [Chorus]



# 3

God made the little birds and flowr's,

And all things large and small;

He'll not forget his little ones,

I know he loves them all.  [Chorus]
