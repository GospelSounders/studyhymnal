# 1

I need Thee every hour,

Most gracious Lord;

No tender voice like Thine

Can peace afford.



Refrain:

I need Thee, O I need Thee!

Every hour I need Thee;

O bless me now, my Saviour!

I come to Thee.



# 2

I need Thee every hour;

Stay Thou near by;

Temptations lose their pow'r

When Thou art nigh.  [Refrain]



# 3

I need Thee every hour,

In joy or pain;

Come quickly and abide,

Or life is vain.  [Refrain]



# 4

I need Thee every hour;

Teach me Thy will,

And Thy rich promises

In me fulfil.  [Refrain]



# 5

I need Thee every hour,

Most Holy One;

O make me Thine indeed,

Thou blessed Son.  [Refrain]
