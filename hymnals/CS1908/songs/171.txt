171 â€“ One Above All Others


1
One there is above all others,
Well deserves the name of Friend;
His is love beyond a brother's,
Costly, free, and knows no end.

2
Which of all our friends, to save us,
Could or would have shed his blood?
But our Jesus died to have us
Reconciled in him to God.

3
O for grace our hearts to soften!
Teach us, Lord, to truly love;
We, alas!  forget too often
What a Friend we have above.
