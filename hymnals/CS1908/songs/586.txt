586 â€“ Look for the Way-Marks


1
Look for the way-marks as you journey on,
Look for the way-marks, passing one by one;
Down thro' the ages, past the kingdoms four,
Where are we standing?
Look the way-marks o'er.

Chorus:
Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,
Down thro' the ages, past the kingdoms four.
Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic waymarks;
The journey's almost o'er.

2
First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,
Then Medo Persia's banners were unfurled;
And after Greece held universal sway,
Rome seized the scepter,
Where are we today?  [Chorus]

3
Down in the feet of iron and of clay,
Weak and divided, soon to pass away;
What will the next great, glorious drama be?
Christ and his coming, 
And eternity.  [Chorus]
