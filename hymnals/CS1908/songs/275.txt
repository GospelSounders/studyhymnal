275 â€“ Valley Lilies


1
Valley lilies, meek and lowly,
Let me hear your message sweet,
Tell of Christ the pure and holy,
Bending as to touch His feet.

Refrain:
Snowy lilies of the valley,
Speak again your message rare;
Testify to me of Jesus,
Heaven's Lily, wondrous fair!

2
Valley lilies, golden hearted,
Love's sweet mission you fulfill,
For you tell in perfumed language,
How he wrought his Father's will.  [Refrain]

3
Valley lilies, cups inverted,
Still the Master you proclaim:
Empty of all pomp and glory,
To redeem the world He came.  [Refrain]
