# 1

Take the Name of Jesus with you,

Child of sorrow and of woe,

It will joy and comfort give you;

Take it then, where’er you go.



# Refrain

Precious Name, O how sweet!

Hope of earth and joy of Heav’n.

Precious Name, O how sweet!

Hope of earth and joy of Heav’n.



# 2

Take the Name of Jesus ever,

As a shield from every snare;

If temptations round you gather,

Breathe that holy Name in prayer.



# 3

O the precious Name of Jesus!

How it thrills our souls with joy,

When His loving arms receive us,

And His songs our tongues employ!



# 4

At the Name of Jesus bowing,

Falling prostrate at His feet,

King of kings in heav’n we’ll crown Him,

When our journey is complete.
