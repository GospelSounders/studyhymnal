1.

There is a land mine eye hath seen

In visions of enraptured tho't,

So bright, that all which spreads between

Is with its radiant glories fraught.



Chorus:

Oh, land of love, of joy and light

Thy glories gild earth's darkest night;

Thy tranquil shore, we, too, shall see,

When day shall break and shadows flee.



2.

A land upon whose blissful shore

There rests no shadow, falls no stain;

There those who meet shall part no more,

And those long parted meet again.  [Chorus]



3.

Its skies are not like earthly skies,

With varying hues of shade and light;

It hath no need of suns, to rise

To dissipate the gloom of night.  [Chorus]



4.

There sweeps no desolating wind

Across the calm, serene abode.

The wand'rer there a home may find

Within the paradise of God.  [Chorus]
