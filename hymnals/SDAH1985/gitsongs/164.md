# 1

There is a green hill far away,

Without a city wall,

Where the dear Lord was crucified,

Who died to save us all.



# 2

We may not know, we cannot tell,

What pains He had to bear,

But we believe it was for us

He hung and suffered there.



# 3

He died that we might be forgiven,

He died to make us good,

That we might go at last to heaven,

Saved by His precious blood.



# 4

There was no other good enough

To pay the price of sin;

He only could unlock the gate

Of heaven, and let us in.



# 5

O dearly, dearly has He loved!

And we must love Him too,

And trust in His redeeming blood,

And try His works to do.
