1.

One sweetly solemm tho't,

Comes to me o'er and o'er;

I'm nearer to my home today,

Than e'er I've been before.



Chorus:

Nearer my home,

Nearer my home;

Nearer my home today, today,

Than e'er I've been before.



2.

Nearer my Father's house,

Where many mansions be;

Nearer the throne where Jesus reigns,

Nearer the crystal sea.  [Chorus]



3.

Nearer my going home,

Laying my burdens down,

Leaving my cross of heavy grief,

Wearing my starry crown.  [Chorus]
