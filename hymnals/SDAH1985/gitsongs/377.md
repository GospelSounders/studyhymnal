# 1

Go forth, go forth with Christ,

Who called you to this day,

He who has led, will lead

And keep you in His way:

His word is fast, His promise sure

To all who serve Him and endure.



# 2

Go forth, go forth with Christ,

With purpose not your own,

Each vict’ry you shall gain

Through Him your Lord alone:

To guard you in fidelity

His Spirit shall your strength’ner be.



# 3

Go forth, go forth with Christ,

His Priesthood you shall share,

Who bought us by His blood

To be His servants here:

Walk in the way your Savior trod,

Go forth with Him, go forth with God.
