# 1

Be not dismayed whate’er betide,

God will take care of you;

beneath his wings of love abide,

God will take care of you.



# Refrain

God will take care of you,

through every day, o’er all the way;

he will take care of you,

God will take care of you.



# 2

Through days of toil when heart doth fail,

God will take care of you;

when dangers fierce your path assail,

God will take care of you.



# 3

All you may need he will provide,

God will take care of you;

nothing you ask will be denied,

God will take care of you.



# 4

No matter what may be the test,

God will take care of you;

lean, weary one, upon his breast,

God will take care of you.
