# 1

Lord, for tomorrow and its needs,

I do not pray;

Keep me from ev'ry stain of sin

Just for today;

Let me no wrong or idle word

Unthinking say;

Set Thou a seal upon my lips,

Just for to-day.



# 2

I would both diligently work

And duly pray;

I would be kind in word and deed

Just for to-day;

O make me strong to do Thy will,

Swift to obey,

Willing to sacrifice myself,

Just for to-day.  



# 3

And if to-day this life of mine

Should ebb away,

O may Thy promises divine,

Still be my stay.

So for tomorrow and its needs I do not pray;

O keep me, guide me, hold me, Lord,

Just for to-day.  Amen.
