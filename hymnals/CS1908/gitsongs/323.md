# 1

When, His salvation bringing,

To Zion Jesus came,

The children all stood singing

"Hosanna" to his name.

Nor did their zeal offend him,

But, as he rode along,

He let them still attend him

And smiled to hear their song.



# 2

And, since the Lord retaineth

His love for children still,

Tho' now as King he reigneth

On Zion's heav'nly hill,

We'll flock around his banner,

Who sits upon the throne,

And cry aloud, "Hosanna

To David's royal Son."



# 3

For, should we fail proclaiming

Our great Redeemer's praise,

These stones, our silence shaming,

Would their hosannas raise.

But shall we only render

The tribute of our words?

Nor, while our hearts are tender,

They too shall be the Lord's.
