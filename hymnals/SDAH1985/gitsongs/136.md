# 1

Good Christians, now rejoice,

With heart, and soul, and voice;

Give ye heed to what we say:

Jesus Christ is born today;

Ox and ass before Him bow,

And He is in the manger now.

Crist is born today!

Crist is born today!



# 2

Good Christians, now rejoice,

With heart, and soul, and voice;

Now ye hear of endless bliss:

Jesus Christ was born for this!

He hath ope’d the heav’nly door,

And we are blessed evermore.

Christ was born for this!

Christ was born for this!



# 3

Good Christians, now rejoice,

With heart, and soul, and voice;

Now ye need not fear the grave:

Jesus Christ was born to save!

Calls you one and calls you all

To gain His everlasting hall.

Christ was born to save!

Christ was born to save!
