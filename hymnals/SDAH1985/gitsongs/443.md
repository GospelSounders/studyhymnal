# 1

There’ll be no night in heaven,

In that blest world above;

No anxious toil, no weary hours;

For labor there is love.



# Refrain

There’ll be no sorrow there,

There’ll be no sorrow there;

In heaven above, where all is love,

There’ll be no sorrow there.



# 2

There’ll be no grief in heaven;

For life is one glad day,

And tears are those of former things

Which all have passed away.



# 3

There’ll be no sin in heaven;

Behold that blessed throng,

All holy in there spotless robes,

All holy in their song.
