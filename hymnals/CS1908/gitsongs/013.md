# 1

"Yet there is room!"  

The Lamb's bright hall of song,

With its fair glory, 

beckons thee along;



Refrain:

Room, room, 

yet there is room;

Come, come, 

come while there's room.



# 2

Daylight declines, 

The sun is sinking low;

The shadows lengthen,

light makes haste to go:  [Refrain]



# 3

The bridal hall 

is filling for the feast:

Pass in!  pass in! 

and be the Bridegroom's guest;  [Refrain]



# 4

It fills, it fills, 

that hall of jubilee!

Make haste, make haste; 

'tis not too full for thee:  [Refrain]



# 5

Yet there is room!

Still open stands the gate,

The gate of love;

it is not yet too late:  [Refrain]



# 6

Pass in, pass in!  

That banquet is for thee;

That cup of everlasting 

love is free:  [Refrain]



# 7

All heaven is there,

all joy!  Go in, go in;

The angels beckon thee

the prize to win:  [Refrain]



# 8

Soon night will close that gate

and seal thy doom:

Then the sad cry,

"No more for me, no room!'  [Refrain]
