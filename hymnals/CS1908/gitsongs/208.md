# 1

There comes to my heart one sweet strain,

A glad and a joyous refrain,

I sing it again and again,

Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.



Chorus:

Peace, peace, sweet peace

Wonderful gift from above

Oh, wonderful, wonderful peace,

Sweet peace the gift of God's love.



# 2

Thro' Christ on the cross peace was made,

My debt by His death was all paid,

No other foundation is laid,

For peace, the gift of God's love.  [Chorus]



# 3

When Jesus as Lord I had crowned,

My heart with this peace did abound,

In Him the rich blessing I found,

Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.  [Chorus]



# 4

In Jesus for peace I abide,

And as I keep close to His side,

There's nothing but peace doth betide,

Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.  [Chorus]
