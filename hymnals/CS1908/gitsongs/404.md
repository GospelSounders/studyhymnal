# 1

Stand up, and bless the Lord,

Ye people of his choice;

Stand up, and bless the Lord your God,

With heart, and soul, and voice.



# 2

Tho' high above all praise,

Above all blessing high,

Who would not fear his holy name,

And laud and magnify?



# 3

O for the living flame

From his own altar brought,

To touch our lips, our souls inspire,

And wing to heav'n our thought!



# 4

God is our strength and song,

And his salvation ours;

Then be his love in Christ proclaimed

With all our ransom'd pow'rs.
