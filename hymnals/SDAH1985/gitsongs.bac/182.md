# 1

Christ is alive!

Let Christians sing.

His cross stands empty to the sky.

Let streets and homes with praises ring.

His love in death shall never die.



# 2

Christ is alive!

No longer bound

To distant years in Palestine,

He comes to claim the here and now

And conquer every place and time.



# 3

In every insult,

rift, and war

Where color, scorn or wealth divide,

He suffers still, yet loves the more,

And lives, though ever crucified.



# 4

Christ is alive!

Ascended Lord

He rules the world His Father made,

Till, in the end, His love adored

Shall be to all on earth displayed.
