# 1

On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,

And cast a wishful eye

To Canaan’s fair and happy land,

Where my possessions lie.

I am bound for the promised land,

I am bound for the promised land;

O who will come and go with me?

I am bound for the promised land.



# 2

O’er all those wide extended plain

Shines one eternal day;

There, Christ, the Sun, for ever reigns,

And scatters night away.

I am bound for the promised land,

I am bound for the promised land;

O who will come and go with me?

I am bound for the promised land.



# 3

When shall I reach that happy place,

And be forever blest?

When shall I see my Father’s face,

And in His kingdom rest?

I am bound for the promised land,

I am bound for the promised land;

O who will come and go with me?

I am bound for the promised land.



# 4

Filled with delight, my raptured soul

Would here no longer stay;

Though Jordan’s waves around me roll,

Fearless I’d launch away.

I am bound for the promised land,

I am bound for the promised land;

O who will come and go with me?

I am bound for the promised land.
