# 1

Teach, me, Father, what to say;

Teach me, Father, how to pray;

Teach me all along the way

How to be like Jesus.



# Refrain

I would be like Jesus,

I would be like Jesus!

Help me, Lord, to daily grow

More and more like Jesus!



# 2

Teach me as the days go by,

Teach me not to reason why,

Teach me that to do and die,

Is to be like Jesus.



# 3

Teach me that the time is short,

Teach me how to live and work,

Teach me that to never shirk

Is to be like Jesus.



# 4

Teach me how we may be one,

Like the Father and the Son;

And when all is overcome,

I will be like Jesus.
