# 1

What a friend we have in Jesus,

All our sins and griefs to bear!

What a privilege to carry

Ev'rything to God in pray'r!

O what peace we often forfeit,

O what needless pain we bear,

All because we do not carry

Ev'rything to God in pray'r!



# 2

Have we trials and temptations?

Is there trouble anywhere?

We should never be discouraged,

Take it to the Lord in pray'r.

Can we find a friend so faithful,

Who will all our sorrows share?

Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness;

Take it to the Lord in pray'r.



# 3

Are we weak and heavy laden,

Cumbered with a load of care?

Precious Saviour, still our refuge,

Take it to the Lord in pray'r;

Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?

Take it to the Lord in pray'r;

In his arms he'll take and shield thee;

Thou wilt find a solace there.
