# 1

Creator of the stars of night,

Thy people’s everlasting light,

O Christ, Thou Saviour of us all,

We pray Thee, hear us when we call.



# 2

At the great name of Jesus, now

All knees must bend, all hearts must bow;

And things celestial Thee shall own,

And things terrestrial, Lord alone.



# 3

To God the Father, God the Son,

And God the Spirit, Three in One,

Laud, honour, might, and glory be

From age to age eternally.

Amen.
