# 1

Pray for the erring ones, faith shall reclaim them;

Doubt not the promises, plead them in prayer.

Loving and merciful, Jesus will save them;

Up to the mercy seat thy loved ones bear.



Refrain:

Always pray, pray for the erring;

Pray in faith, Jesus will hear;

Always pray, pray for the erring;

Prayer brings the wand'rers near.



# 2

Plead with them tenderly, point them to Jesus;

Tho' justly sorrowing, do not despair.

Kneel in the darkest hour, firmly believing;

On Christ the crucified cast all your care.  [Refrain]



# 3

Let thine example be worthy thy calling,

Thy life is witnessing each day and hour.

Thousands now perishing long for a Saviour;

Show forth his wondrous love, tell of his power.  [Refrain]



# 4

Walk with the Perfect One, choosing none other;

His robe of righteousness joyfully wear;

So shall the erring see beauty in Jesus,

So shall the Father hear and grant thy prayer.  [Refrain]
