# 1

Depth of mercy!  can there be

Mercy still reserved for me?

Can my God his wrath forbear?

Me, the chief of sinners, spare?



# 2

I have long withstood his grace,

Long provoked him to his face,

Would not hearken to his calls,

Griev'd him by a thousand falls.



# 3

There for me the Saviour stands,

Shows his wounds and spreads his hands;

God is love!  I know, I feel;

Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
