# 1

Am I a soldier of the cross,

a follower of the Lamb,

and shall I fear to own his cause,

or blush to speak his name?



# 2

Must I be carried to the skies

on flowery beds of ease,

while others fought to win the prize,

and sailed through bloody seas?



# 3

Are there no foes for me to face?

Must I not stem the flood?

Is this vile world a friend to grace,

to help me on to God?



# 4

Sure I must fight, if I would reign;

increase my courage, Lord

I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain,

supported by thy word



# 5

Thy saints in all this glorious war

shall conquer though they die;

they see the triumph from afar,

by faith they bring it nigh



# 6

When that illustrious day shall rise,

and all thy armies shine

in robes of victory through the skies,

the glory shall be thine
