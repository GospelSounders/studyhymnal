# 1

Where He may lead me I will go,

For I have learned to trust Him so,

And I remember 'twas for me,

That He was slain on Calvary.



Chorus:

Jesus shall lead me night and day,

Jesus shall lead me all the way,

He is the truest Friend to me,

For I remember Calvary.



# 2

O I delight in His command,

Love to be led by His dear hand,

His divine will is sweet to me,

Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.  [Chorus]



# 3

Onward I go, nor doubt, nor fear,

Happy with Christ, my Saviour near,

Trusting that I some day shall see

Jesus my Friend, of Calvary.  [Chorus]
