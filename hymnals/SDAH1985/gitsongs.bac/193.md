# 1

Saviour, teach me day by day,

Love’s sweet lesson to obey,

Sweeter lesson cannot be,

Loving Him who first loved me.



# 2

With a child’s glad heart of love,

At Thy bidding may I move,

Prompt to serve and follow Thee,

Loving Him who first loved me.



# 3

Teach me I am not my own,

I am Thine, and Thine alone;

Thine to keep, to rule, to save

From all sin that would enslave.



# 4

Love in loving finds employ,

In obedience all her joy;

Ever new that joy will be,

Loving Him who first loved me.



# 5

Teach me thus Thy steps to trace,

Strong to follow in Thy grace.

Learning how to love from Thee,

Loving Him who first loved me.
