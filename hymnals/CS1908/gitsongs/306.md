# 1

Fade, fade each earthly joy,

Jesus is mine!

Break ev'ry tender tie,

Jesus is mine!

Dark is the wilderness,

Earth has no resting place,

Jesus alone can bless,

Jesus is mine!



# 2

Tempt not my soul away,

Jesus is mine! 

Here would I ever stay,

Jesus is mine!

Perishing things of clay,

Born but for one brief day,

Pass from my heart away,

Jesus is mine!



# 3

Farewell, ye dreams of night,

Jesus is mine!

Lost in this dawning light,

Jesus is mine!

All that my soul has tried,

Left but a dismal void,

Jesus has satisfied,

Jesus is mine!



# 4

Farewell, mortality,

Jesus is mine!

Welcome eternity,

Jesus is mine!

Welcome, O lov'd and blest,

Welcome, sweet scenes of rest,

Welcome my Saviour's breast,

Jesus is mine!
