# 1

Father, I stretch my hands to thee;

No other help I know;

If thou withdraw thyself from me,

Ah, whither shall I go?



# 2

On thy dear Son I now believe,

O let me feel thy pow'r;

And all my varied wants relieve,

In this accepted hour.



# 3

Author of faith!  to thee I lift

My weary, longing eyes:

O let me now receive that gift;

My soul without it dies.
