What wondrous love is this,

O my soul, O my soul?

What wondrous love is this, O my soul?

What wondrous love is this

That caused the Lord of bliss

To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul;

To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul;



# 2

To God and to the Lamb

I will sing, I will sing;

To God and to the Lamb, I will sing;

To God and to the Lamb

Who is the great I am,

While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing;

While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing;



# 3

And when from death I’m free,

I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on;

And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on;

And when from death I’m free,

I’ll sing and joyful be,

And through eternity I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on!

And through eternity, I’ll sing on.
