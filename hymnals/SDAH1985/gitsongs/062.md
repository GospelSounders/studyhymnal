# 1

How lovely is Thy dwelling place,

O Lord of hosts to me!

The tabenacles of Thy grace

How pleasant, Lord, they be!



# 2

My thirsty soul longs ardently,

Yea, faints Thy courts to see;

My very heart and flesh cry out,

O living God, for Thee.



# 3

Behold the sparrow findeth out

A house where-in to rest;

The swallow also, for herself

Provided hath a nest.



# 4

Ev’n Thine own altars, where she safe

Her young ones forth may bring,

O Thou, almighty Lord of hosts,

Who art my God and King.



# 5

Blest are they in Thy house that dwell,

They ever give Thee praise.

Blest is the man whose strength Thou art,

In whose heart are Thy ways.
