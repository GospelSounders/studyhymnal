532 – Seeking the Lost


1
Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating
Wanderers on the mountains astray,
"Come unto me," his message repeating,
Words of the Master speaking today.

Chorus:
Going afar, afar upon the mountain,
Bringing the wand'rers, the wand'rers back again,
Into the fold, the fold of my Redeemer
Jesus the Lamb, the Lamb for sinners slain.

2
Seeking the lost, and pointing to Jesus
Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,
Leading them forth in ways of salvation,
Showing the path to life evermore.  [Chorus]

3
Thus would I go, for Jesus hath call'd me,
Him would I follow day unto day;
Care for the dying, raise up the fallen,
Pointing the lost to Jesus the way.  [Chorus]
