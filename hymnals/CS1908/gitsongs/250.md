# 1

Don't forget the Sabbath,

The Lord our God hath blest,

Of all the week the brightest,

Of all the week the best;

It brings repose from labor,

It tells of joy divine,

Its beams of light descending,

With heav'nly beauty shine.



Chorus:

Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,

Blessed Sabbath day.

Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,

Blessed Sabbath day.



# 2

Keep the Sabbath holy,

And worship him today,

Who said to his disciples

"I am the Living Way;"

And if we meekly follow

Our Saviour here below,

He'll give us of the Fountain

Whose streams eternal flow.  [Chorus]



# 3

Day of sacred pleasure!

Its golden hours we'll spend

In thankful hymns to Jesus,

The children's dearest friend;

O gentle, loving Saviour,

How good and kind thou art,

How precious is thy promise

To dwell in ev'ry heart!  [Chorus]
