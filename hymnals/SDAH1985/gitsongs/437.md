# 1

My heav’nly home is bright and fair,

Nor pain nor death can enter there;

It’s glitt’ring tow’rs the sun outshine,

That heav’nly mansion shall me mine.



# Refrain

I’m going home, I’m going home,

I’m going home to die no more;

To die no more; to die no more-

I’m going home to die no more.



# 2

My Father’s house is built on high,

Far, far above the starry sky;

When from this earthly prison free,

That heav’nly mansion mine shall be.



# 3

Let others seek a home below,

Which flames devour or waves oe’r flow;

Be mine a happier lot to own

A heav’nly mansion near the throne.
