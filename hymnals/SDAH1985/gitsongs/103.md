# 1

O God, our help in ages past,

our hope for years to come,

our shelter from the stormy blast,

and our eternal home!



# 2

Under the shadow of thy throne,

still may we dwell secure;

sufficient is thine arm alone,

and our defense is sure.



# 3

Before the hills in order stood,

or earth received her frame,

from everlasting, thou art God,

to endless years the same.



# 4

A thousand ages, in thy sight,

are like an evening gone;

short as the watch that ends the night,

before the rising sun.



# 5

O God, our help in ages past,

our hope for years to come;

be thou our guide while life shall last,

and our eternal home!
