# 1

Rest of the weary, 

Joy of the sad,

Hope of the dreary, 

Light of the glad;

Home of the stranger, 

Strength to the end,

Refuge from danger, 

Saviour and Friend;

Refuge from danger, 

Saviour and Friend,

Saviour and Friend.



# 2

Pillow where lying, 

Love rests her head;

Peace of the dying, 

Life of the dead;

Path of the lowly,

Prize at the end,

Breath of the holy,

Saviour and Friend;

Breath of the holy, 

Saviour and Friend,

Saviour and Friend.



# 3

When my feet stumble,

To Thee I cry;

Crown of the humble, 

Cross of the high;

When my steps wander,

Over me bend,

Truer and fonder,

Saviour and Friend;

True and fonder,

Saviour and Friend,

Saviour and Friend.



# 4

Ever confessing Thee,

I will raise

Unto Thee blessing,

Glory, and praise;

All my endeavor,

World without end,

Thine to be ever,

Saviour and Friend;

Thine to be ever,

Saviour and Friend,

Saviour and Friend.
