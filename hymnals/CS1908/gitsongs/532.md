# 1

Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating

Wanderers on the mountains astray,

"Come unto me," his message repeating,

Words of the Master speaking today.



Chorus:

Going afar, afar upon the mountain,

Bringing the wand'rers, the wand'rers back again,

Into the fold, the fold of my Redeemer

Jesus the Lamb, the Lamb for sinners slain.



# 2

Seeking the lost, and pointing to Jesus

Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,

Leading them forth in ways of salvation,

Showing the path to life evermore.  [Chorus]



# 3

Thus would I go, for Jesus hath call'd me,

Him would I follow day unto day;

Care for the dying, raise up the fallen,

Pointing the lost to Jesus the way.  [Chorus]
