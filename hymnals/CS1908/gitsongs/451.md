# 1

Before Jehovah's awful throne,

Ye nations bow with sacred joy;

Know that the Lord is God alone;

He can create, and he destroy.



# 2

We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,

High as the heav'ns voices raise;

And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,

Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.



# 3

Wide as the world is thy command,

Vast as eternity thy love;

Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,

When rolling years shall cease to move.
