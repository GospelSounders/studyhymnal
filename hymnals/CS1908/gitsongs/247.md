# 1

Each cooing dove and sighing bough

That makes the eve so blest to me,

Has something far diviner now,

It bears me back to Galilee.



Chorus:  

O Galilee, sweet Galilee,

Where Jesus loved so much to be,

O Galilee, blue Galilee,

Come, sing thy song again to me.



# 2

Each flow'ry glen and mossy dell,

Where happy birds in song agree,

Thro' sunny morn the praises tell,

Of sight and sounds in Galilee.  [Chorus]



# 3

And when I read the thrilling lore,

Of him who walk'd upon the sea,

I long, oh, how I long once more,

To follow him in Galilee.  [Chorus]
