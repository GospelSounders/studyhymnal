# 1

Maker of land and rolling sea,

We dedicate this house to thee;

And what our willing hands have done,

We give to God and to the Son.



# 2

Come, fill this house with heav'nly grace,

While sinners throng the sacred place,

And saints, with angel hosts above,

Unite to sing redeeming love.



# 3

Here, let the mourning soul find rest

Upon the loving Saviour's breast;

And with the sense of sins forgiv'n,

Each heart aspire to God and heav'n.
