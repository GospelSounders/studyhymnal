# 1

Fairest Lord Jesus,

Ruler of all nature,

O Thou of God and man the Son!

Thee will I cherish,

Thee will I honor,

Thou art my glory, joy, and crown.



# 2

Fair are the meadows,

Fairer still the woodlands,

Robed in the blooming garb of spring;

Jesus is fairer,

Jesus is purer,

Who makes the woeful heart to sing.



# 3

Fair is the sunshine,

Fairer still the moonlight,

And all the twinkling, starry host;

Jesus shines brighter,

Jesus shines purer

Than all the angels heav'n can boast.  Amen.
