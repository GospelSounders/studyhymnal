1.

When we lay our burdens down,

Sometime, sometime;

When we take the harp and crown

In that city of renown,

We shall sing sometime,

Sometime, sometime.



Refrain:

We shall sing, sometime,

We shall sing, sometime;

Where the heart is never sad,

Where the dwellers all are glad,

In that happy, Eden clime,

We shall sing, sometime.



2.

We shall meet to part no more,

Sometime, sometime;

On that blest immortal shore,

Where the reign of death is o'er,

We shall meet sometime,

Sometime, sometime.



Refrain:

We shall meet, sometime,

We shall meet, sometime;

Where the heart is never sad,

Where the dwellers all are glad,

In that happy, Eden clime,

We shall meet, sometime.



3.

In that bright eternal day

Sometime, sometime;

Tears shall all be wiped away,

And we never more shall say,

We shall sing sometime,

Sometime, sometime.



Refrain:

We shall sing, sometime,

We shall sing, sometime;

Where the heart is never sad,

Where the dwellers all are glad,

In that happy, Eden clime,

We shall sing, sometime.
