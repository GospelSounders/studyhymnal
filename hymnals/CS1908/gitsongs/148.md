# 1

I bring my sins to Thee,

The sins I cannot count,

That all may cleansed be,

In thy once opened Fount; 

I bring them, Saviour, all to thee;

The burden is too great for me.



# 2

I bring my grief to Thee,

The grief I cannot tell;

No words shall needed be,

Thou knowest all so well:

I bring the sorrow laid on me,

O suff'ring Saviour!  all to thee.



# 3

My heart to thee I bring,

The heart I cannot read,

A faithless, wand'ring thing,

An evil heart indeed:

I bring it, Saviour, now to thee,

That fix'd and faithful it may be.



# 4

My life I bring to thee,

I would not be my own;

O Saviour let me be Thine, ever thine alone

My heart, my life, my all, I bring

To thee, my Saviour and my King.
