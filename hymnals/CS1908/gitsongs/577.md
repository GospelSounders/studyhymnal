# 1

Beautiful the little hands

That fulfill the Lord's commands;

Beautiful the little eyes,

Kindled with light from the skies.



Chorus:

Beautiful, beautiful, are the hands

That fulfill the Lord's commands;

Beautiful, beautiful, are the eyes,

Kindled with light from the skies.



# 2

All the little hands were made

Jesus precious cause to aid;

All the little hearts to beat 

Warm in his service so sweet.  [Chorus]



# 3

All the little lips should pray

To the Saviour ev'ry day;

All the little feet should go

Swift on his errands below.  [Chorus]



# 4

What your little hands can do,

That the Lord intends for you;

Make that thing your first delight,

Do it for him with your might.  [Chorus]
