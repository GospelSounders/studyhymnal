840 â€“ Repose


1.
Now the day is over,
Night is drawing nigh,
Shadows of the evening
Steal across the sky.

2.
Father, give the weary
Calm and sweet repose,
With thy tend'rest blessing
May our eye-lids close.

3.
Thro' the long night watches,
May thine angels spread
Their white wings above me,
Watching round my bed.  Amen.
