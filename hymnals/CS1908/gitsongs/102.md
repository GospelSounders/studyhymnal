102 – A Sinner Like Me


1
I was once far away from the Saviour,
And as vile as a sinner could be;
I wondered if Christ, the Redeemer,
Could save a poor sinner like me.

2
I wandered on in the darkness,
Not a ray of light could I see,
And the tho't filled my heart with sadness,
There's no help for a sinner like me.

3
And then in that dark, lonely hour,
A voice sweetly whispered to me,
Saying Christ, the Redeemer, has power
To save a poor sinner like me.

4
I listened, and lo!  'twas the Savior
Who was speaking so kindly to me;
I cried, I'm the chief of sinners,
Oh, save a poor sinner like me.

5
I then fully trusted in Jesus,
And, oh, what a joy came to me!
My heart was filled with his praises,
For saving a sinner like me.

6
No longer in darkness I'm walking,
For the light is now shining on me,
And now unto others I'm telling
How he saved a poor sinner like me.

7
And when life's journey is over,
And I the dear Saviour shall see,
I'll praise him for ever and ever,
For saving a sinner like me.
