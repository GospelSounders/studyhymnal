# 1

My Shepherd will supply my need,

Jehovah is His name.

In pastures fresh He makes me feed

Beside the living stream.

He brings my wand’ring spirit back

When I forsake His ways,

And leads, me for His mercy’s sake,

In paths of truth and grace.



# 2

When I walk through the shades of death,

Thy presence is my stay;

A word of Thy supporting breath

Drives all my fears away.

Thy hand in sight of all my foes

Doth still my table spread;

My cup with blessings overflows,

Thine oil anoints my head.



# 3

The sure provisions of my God

Attend me all my days;

O may Thy house be mine abode

And all my work be praise.

There would I find a settled rest

While others go and come;

No more a stranger or a guest,

But like a child at home.
