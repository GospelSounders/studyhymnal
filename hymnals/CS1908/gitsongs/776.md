1.

Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear

My voice ascending high;

To thee will I direct my prayer,

To thee lift up mine eye,



2.

O may thy Spirit guide my feet

In ways of righteousness!

Make ev'ry path of duty straight

And plain before my face.



3.

The men that love and fear thy name

Shall see their hopes fulfilled;

The mighty God will compass them

With favor as a shield.
