296 â€“ Walking With Thee


1
Walking with thee, my God,
Saviour benign,
Daily confer on me
Converse divine;
Jesus, in thee restores,
Brother, and blessed Lord,
Let it be mine,
Let it be mine.

2
Walking with thee, my God,
Like as a child
Leans on his father's strength,
Crossing the wild.
And by the way is taught
Lessons of holy tho't,
Faith undefiled,
Faith undefiled.

3
Walking with thee, my God,
Humbly with thee;
Yet from all care and fear
Lovingly free.
E'en as a friend with friend,
Chee'rd to the journey's end,
Walking with thee,
Walking with thee.
