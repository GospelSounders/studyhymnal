1.

Now the day is over,

Night is drawing nigh,

Shadows of the evening

Steal across the sky.



2.

Father, give the weary

Calm and sweet repose,

With thy tend'rest blessing

May our eye-lids close.



3.

Thro' the long night watches,

May thine angels spread

Their white wings above me,

Watching round my bed.  Amen.
