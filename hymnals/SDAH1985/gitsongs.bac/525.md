# 1

O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,

My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;

So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine, would I be;

Thou blest “Rock of Ages,” I’m hiding in Thee.



# Refrain

Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,

Thou blest “Rock of Ages,”

I’m hiding in Thee.



# 2

In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow’s lone hour,

In times when temptation casts over me its power;

In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,

Thou blest “Rock of Ages,“ I’m hiding in Thee.



# 3

How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,

I have fled to my refuge and breathed out my woe;

How often, when trials like sea billows roll,

Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.
