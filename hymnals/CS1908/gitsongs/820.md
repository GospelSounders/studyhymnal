820 â€“ Shepherd Divine


1.
Shepherd divine, thou leadest me
Where the still waters gently flow;
In pastures fair thou feedest me;
I trust thy love, no want I know.

2.
In danger's hour thou hidest me,
Safe from the foe of thy dear flock;
At sultry noon thou guidest me
To rest beside the cooling rock.

3.
When chilling dews of evening fall,
Then to the fold thou bidst me come;
Gladly I hasten at thy call;
Sweet is the voice that calls me home.
