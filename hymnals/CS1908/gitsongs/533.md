# 1

Would you win a Saviour's blessing?

Freely, freely give;

Would you see his work progressing?

Freely, freely give;

Let your souls with love expand,

Open wide a liberal hand;

Would you follow God's command?

Freely, freely give.



# 2

With a cheerful heart and willing,

Freely, freely give;

Like the dew its balm distilling,

Freely, freely give;

Have you little?  Give your mite;

O how precious in his sight!

He your off'ring will requite;

Freely, freely give.



# 3

Give to spread the grand Old Story,

Freely, freely give;

Give to speed the light of glory,

Freely, freely give;

Would you gain a rich reward

In the harvest of the Lord?

Then obedient to his word,

Freely, freely give.
