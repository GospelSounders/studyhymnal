# 1

O, Comfort to the dreary!

O, Joy to the oppressed!

"Come unto Me, ye weary,

And I will give you rest."

O, come with all your weakness,

Come with your load of woe;

And learn if him with meekness

All righteousness to know.



# 3

Ye who the world have courted,

And suffer'd from its spite;

Ye who with sin have sported,

And felt its serpent bite;

Come, learn, your follies quitting,

That this world's gain is loss;

To Christ's light yoke submitting,

Come, and take up the cross. 



# 4

O come and make the trial;

Christ's service is release;

If hard the self denial,

Its fruit is joy and peace.

His word your faith defending,

Shall serve you for the strife;

Peace all your steps attending;

The prime, eternal life!
