1.

Sweet be thy rest,

And peaceful thy sleeping;

God's way is best,

Thou art in his keeping.

O blessed sleep,

Where ills ne'er molest thee!

Why should we weep?

For heaven hath blessed thee:

Sweet be thy rest.



2.

Thy work is done,

Thy sowing and reaping;

Thy crown is won,

And hush'd is thy weeping.

From tears and woes,

From earth's midnight dreary,

Thine is repose

Where none ever weary:

Sweet be thy rest.



3.

Sweet be thy rest;

No more we may greet thee

Till with the blest

In heaven we meet thee.

O union sweet,

That death can not sever!

There we shall meet,

Where sad tears fall never:

Sweet be thy rest.
