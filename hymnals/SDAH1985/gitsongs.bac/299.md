# 1

“Forgive our sins as we forgive,”

You taught us, Lord, to pray;

But You alone can grant us grace

To live the words we say.



# 2

How can Your pardon reach and bless

The unforgiving heart

That broods on wrongs and will not let

Old bitterness depart?



# 3

In blazing light Your cross reveals

The truth we dimly knew:

How trifling others’ debts to us;

How great our debt to You!



# 4

Lord, cleanse the depths within our souls

And bid resentment cease;

Then, by Your mercy reconciled,

Our lives will spread Your peace.
