# 1

Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life:

such a way as gives us breath,

such a truth as ends all strife,

such a life as killeth death.



# 2

Come, my Light, my Feast, my Strength:

such a light as shows a feast,

such a feast as mends in length,

such a strength as makes his guest.



# 3

Come, my Joy, my Love, my Heart:

such a joy as none can move,

such a love as none can part,

such a heart as joys in love.
