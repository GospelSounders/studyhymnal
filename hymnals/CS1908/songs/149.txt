149 â€“ Take All My Sin Away


1
O spotless Lamb!  I come to thee,
No longer can I from thee stay;
Break ev'ry chain, now set me free,
Take all my sin away.

Chorus:
Take all my sin away,
Take all my sin away;
O spotless Lamb, I come to thee;    
Take all my sin away.

2
Weary I am of inbred sin,
Oh, wilt thou not my soul release?
Enter and speak me pure within,
Give me thy perfect peace.  [Chorus]

3
I plunge beneath thy precious blood,
My hand in faith takes hold of thee;
Thy promises just now I claim;
Thou art enough for me.   

Chorus:
Take all my sin away,
Take all my sin away;
O spotless Lamb, I come to thee;
He takes my sin away.
