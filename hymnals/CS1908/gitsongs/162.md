# 1

O, could I find, from day to day,

A nearness to my God,

Then would my hours glide sweet away,

While leaning on his word.



# 2

Lord, I desire with thee to live

Anew from day to day,

In joys the world can never give,

Nor ever take away.



# 3

Blest Jesus, come, and rule my heart,

And make me wholly thine,

That I may nevermore depart,

Nor grieve thy love divine.
