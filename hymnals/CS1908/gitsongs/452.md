# 1

Jesus, thou joy of loving hearts!

Thou fount of life!  thou light of men!

From the best bliss that earth imparts,

We turn unfill'd to thee again.



# 2

We taste thee, O thou Living Bread,

And long to feast upon thee still;

We drink of thee, the Fountainhead,

As thirst our souls from thee to fill.



# 3

Our restless spirits yearn for thee,

Where'er our changeful lot is cast;

Glad, when thy gracious smile we see,

Blest, when our faith can hold thee fast.



# 4

O Jesus, ever with us stay;

Make all our moments calm and bright;

Chase the dark night of sin away,

Shed o'er the world thy holy light!
