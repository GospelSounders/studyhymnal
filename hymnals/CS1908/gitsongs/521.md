# 1

Look upon the golden image,

Hear the king's decree,

See the burning fiery furnace,

And the faithful three.



Chorus:

Stand for the right

Wherever you may be,

Trust in the Lord,

Like the faithful three.

We will follow their example,

Brave and faithful three,

Bowing not before the image

At the world's decree.



# 2

'Twas a heathen king's commandment

Governed conscience then,

Yet how bravely for Jehovah

Stood those noble men!  [Chorus]



# 3

So when earthly creeds of error

Bid you bend the knee,

Turn and read the simple story

Of the faithful three.  [Chorus]



# 4

God is able to deliver

As in days of old,

All who walk the path of duty,

Fearless, firm, and bold.  [Chorus]
