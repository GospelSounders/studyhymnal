# 1

The angel of the Lord encampeth

Round about us, round about us;

Round about the souls that fear him,

Night and day.



Chorus:

O pillar of fire, pillar of cloud,

Lead me, lead me ev'ry day!

O pillar of fire, pillar of cloud,

Lead me on my heav'nly way.



# 2

When danger hovers o'er our pathway,

He will hide us, he will hide us,

Safe within the mighty shadow 

Of his wing.  [Chorus]



# 3

We'll trust thee as we onward journey,

God of Israel, God of Israel,

Till we reach the land of promise,

Just before.  [Chorus]
