# 1

O, for a faith that will not shrink,

Though pressed by many a foe,

That will not tremble on the brink of poverty,

Of poverty or woe; Of poverty or woe;



# 2

That will not murmur or complain

Beneath the chastening rod,

But in the hour of grief or pain, of grief or pain

Can lean upon its God; Can lean upon its God.



# 3

A faith that shines more bright and clear

When tempests rage without;

That when in danger knows no fear, knows of no fear,

In darkness feels no doubt; In darkness feels no doubt.



# 4

That bears unmoved the world’s dread frown,

Nor heeds its scornful smile;

That sin’s wild ocean cannot drown, no, cannot drown,

Nor its soft arts beguile; Nor its soft arts beguile.



# 5

Lord, give me such a faith as this,

And then, whate’er may come

I’ll taste, e’en here the hallowed bliss, the hallowed bliss

Of an eternal home; Of an eternal home.
