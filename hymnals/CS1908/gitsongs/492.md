# 1

Does Jesus care when my heart is pain'd

Too deeply for mirth or song;

As the burdens press,

And the cares distress,

And the way grows weary and long?



Chorus:

O yes, He cares, I know He cares,

His heart is touched with my grief;

When the days are weary,

The long nights dreary,

I know my Saviour cares.



# 2

Does Jesus care when my way is dark

With a nameless dread and fear?

As the daylight fades

Into deep night shades,

Does He care enough to be near?  [Chorus]



# 3

Does Jesus care when I've tried and fail'd

To resist some temptation strong?

When in my deep grief

I find no relief,

Tho' my tears flow all the night long?  [Chorus]



# 4

Does Jesus care when I've said "good-bye"

To the dearest on earth to me,

And my sad heart aches

'Till it nearly breaks

Is this aught to Him?  does He see?  [Chorus]
