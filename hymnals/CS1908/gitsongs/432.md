# 1

How sweet upon this sacred day,

The best of all the sev'n,

To cast our earthly thoughts away,

And think of God and heav'n.



# 2

How sweet the words of peace to hear

From him to whom 'tis giv'n

To wake the penitential fear,

And lead the way to heav'n.



# 3

And if to make our sins depart,

In vain the will has striv'n,

He who regards the inmost heart

Will send his grace from heav'n.
