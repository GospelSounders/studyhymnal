# 1

O day of rest and gladness,

O day of joy and light,

O balm of care and sadness,

Most beautiful, most bright,

On thee the high and lowly

Before th’ eternal throne

Sing, “Holy, holy, holy,”

To the great Three in One.



# 2

Thou art a port protected

From storms that round us rise;

A garden intersected

With streams of paradise;

Thou art a cooling fountain

In life’s dry dreary sand;

From Thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,

We view our promised land.



# 3

A day of sweet reflection

Thou art, a day of love,

A day to raise affection

From earth to things above.

New graces ever gaining

From this our day of rest,

We seek the rest remaining

To mansions of the blest.
