# 1

O for a thousand tongues to sing

my great Redeemer’s praise,

the glories of my God and King,

the triumphs of his grace!



# 2

My gracious Master and my God,

assist me to proclaim,

to spread through all the earth abroad

the honors of thy name.



# 3

Jesus! the name that charms our fears,

that bids our sorrows cease;

’tis music in the sinner’s ears,

’tis life, and health, and peace.



# 4

He breaks the power of canceled sin,

he sets the prisoner free;

his blood can make the foulest clean;

his blood availed for me.



# 5

He speaks, and listening to his voice,

new life the dead receive;

the mournful, broken hearts rejoice,

the humble poor believe.



# 6

Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,

your loosened tongues employ;

ye blind, behold your savior come,

and leap, ye lame, for joy.
