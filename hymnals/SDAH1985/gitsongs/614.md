# 1

Sound the battle cry,

See! the foe is nigh;

Raise the standard high

For the Lord;

Gird your armor on,

Stand firm, every one,

Rest your cause upon His holy word.



# Refrain

Rouse, then soldiers!

rally round the banner!

Ready, steady, pass the word along;

Onward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!

Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.



# 2

Strong to meet the foe,

Marching on we go,

While our cause we know

Must prevail;

Shield and banner bright,

Gleaming in the light,

Battling for the right,

We ne’er can fail.



# 3

O Thou God of all,

Hear us when we call,

Help us, one and all,

By Thy grace;

When the battle’s done,

And the victory won,

May we wear the crown

Before Thy face.
