# 1

Christ is ris'n, our Lord and King,

Let the whole creation sing;

Raise your joys and triumphs high;

Sing, ye heav'ns, let earth reply.



# 2

Vain the stone, the watch, the seal,

Christ the mighty, to conceal;

Death in vain forbids him rise,

He hath opened paradise.



# 3

Lead us, Lord, where thou hast led,

Thou, our High, exalted Head;

Made like thee, by thee we rise;

Ours the cross, the grave, the skies.
