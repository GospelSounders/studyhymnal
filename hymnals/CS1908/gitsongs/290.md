# 1

Since on my Saviour I believed,

His beams around me shine;

The Spirit's witness I received,

I know that He is mine.



Chorus:

"I know whom I have believed,

and am persuaded that He is able

To keep what I have committed

unto Him against that day."



# 2

I know His love, His faithful care;

His mighty saving pow'r;

His willingness to answer pray'r,

His grace in sun and show'r.  [Chorus]



# 3

In His dear wounded hands I leave

All that concerneth me;

The flow'rs that please, the thorns that grieve,

Shall fraught with blessing be.  [Chorus]



# 4

Tho' all things else should pass away,

He changeless, would remain.

So will I sing, till dawns His day,

Faith's jubilant refrain.  [Chorus]
