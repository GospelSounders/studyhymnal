460 â€“ Sweetly the Holy Hymn


1
Sweetly the holy hymn
Breaks on the morning air;
Before the world with smoke is dim,
We meet to offer prayer.

2
While flow'rs are wet with dews,
Dew of our souls, descend;
Ere yet the sun the day renews,
O Lord, Thy Spirit send.

3
Upon the battlefield,
Before the fight begins,
We seek, O Lord, Thy shelt'ring shield,
To guard us from our sins.

4
On the lone mountain side,
Before the morning's light,
The Man of sorrows wept and cried,
And rose refreshed with might.

5
Oh, hear us then, for we
Are very weak and frail,
We make the Saviour's name our plea,
And surely must prevail.
