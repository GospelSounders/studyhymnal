# 1

Thou who on the cross didst make

Sacrifice complete for me;

Thou who didst for my poor sake

Suffer on the cursed tree;

Thou didst teach submission sweet,

Washing the disciples' feet.



# 2

O my soul!  and shalt thou scorn

Thus to do as He hath done?

Thou a wretched, dying worm;

He the blessed, sinless One!

Gladly would I wish his feet,

Bowing in submission sweet.



# 3

Such a joy may not be mine,

Thus to prove my love for thee;

Such a privilege divine

Thou hast never given me;

But, in blest submission sweet,

Kneel I at thy servant's feet.
