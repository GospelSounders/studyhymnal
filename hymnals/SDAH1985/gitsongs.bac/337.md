# 1

Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!

Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;

Redeemed through His infinite mercy,

His child and forever I am.



# Refrain

Redeemed, redeemed,

Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;

Redeemed, redeemed,

His child and forever I am.



# 2

Redeemed, and so happy in Jesus,

No language my rapture can tell;

I know that the light of His presence

With me doth continually dwell.



# 3

I know there’s a crown that is waiting

In yonder bright mansion for me;

And soon, with the spirit made perfect,

At home with the Lord I shall be.
