# 1

Hear the pennies dropping!

Listen while they fall;

Ev'ry one for Jesus,

He will get them all,



Refrain:

Dropping, dropping, dropping, dropping;

Hear the pennies fall!

Ev'ry one for Jesus,

He will get them all.



# 2

Dropping, dropping ever.

From each little hand;

'Tis our gift to Jesus,

From his little band.  [Refrain]



# 3

Now, while we are little.

Pennies are are store;

But, when we are older,

Lord, we'll give thee more.  [Refrain]



# 4

Tho, we've little money.

We can give him love;

He will own our off'ring,

Smiling from above.  [Refrain]
