# 1

Dear Lord, we come at set of sun,

And at Your feet we kneel

To worship You, Creator, King,

This day, Your sign and seal.



# 2

Our earthly tasks we lay aside,

According to Your Word,

To enter now Your holy rest,

The Sabbath of the Lord.



# 3

Sweet Sabbath rest, your sacred hours

Are as a golden chain

That reaches back to Eden’s gate

And points us home again.



# 4

And when this earth shall be renewed,

And sin and death destroyed,

Shall all redeemed each Sabbath day

Still meet to praise their God.
