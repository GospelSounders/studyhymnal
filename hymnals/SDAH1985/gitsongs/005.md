# 1

All my hope on God is founded;

He doth still my trust renew.

Me through change and chance He guideth,

Only good and only true.

God unknown, He alone

Calls my heart to be His own.



# 2

Pride of man and earthly glory,

Sword and crown betray his trust;

What with care and toil he buildeth,

Tower and temple fall to dust.

But God’s power, hour by hour,

Is my temple and my tower.



# 3

God’s great goodness aye endureth,

Deep His wisdom, passing thought;

Splendor, light and life attend Him,

Beauty springeth out of naught.

Love doth stand at His hand;

Joy doth wait on His command.



# 4

Still from man to God eternal,

Sacrifice of praise be done.

High above all praises praising,

For the gift of Christ His son.

Christ doth call one and all:

Ye who follow shall not fall.
