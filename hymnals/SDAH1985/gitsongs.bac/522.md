# 1

My hope is built on nothing less

than Jesus’ blood and righteousness.

I dare not trust the sweetest frame,

but wholly lean on Jesus’ name.



# Refrain

On Christ the solid rock I stand;

all other ground is sinking sand,

all other ground is sinking sand.



# 2

When Darkness veils his lovely face,

I rest on his unchanging grace.

in every high and stormy gale,

my anchor holds within the veil.



# 3

His oath, his covenant, his blood

supports me in the whelming flood.

When all around my soul gives way,

he then is all my hope and stay.



# 4

When He shall come with trumpet sound,

O may I then in him be found!

Dressed in his righteousness alone,

faultless to stand before the throne.
