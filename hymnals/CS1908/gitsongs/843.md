843 â€“ Work Till Jesus Comes


1.
O land of rest, for thee I sigh;
When will the moment come
When I shall lay my armor by, 
And dwell with Christ at home?

Chorus:
We'll work till Jesus comes,
We'll work till Jesus comes,
We'll work till Jesus comes,
And we'll be gathered home.

2.
No tranquil joys on earth I know,
No peace, shelt'ring dome;
This world's a wilderness of woe,
This world is not my home.

3.
When by affliction sharply tried,
Faith tells of scenes to come,
Those endless joys prepared above,
And then I sigh for home.
