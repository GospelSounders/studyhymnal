# 1

Thanks to God whose Word was spoken

In the deed that made the earth.

His the voice that called a nation;

His the fires that tried her worth.

God has spoken;

Praise Him For His open Word



# 2

Thanks to God whose Word incarnate

Glorified the flesh of man.

Deeds and words and death and rising

Tell the grace in heaven’s plan.

God has spoken;

Praise Him For His open Word



# 3

Thanks to God whose Word is answered

By the Spirit’s voice within.

Here we drink of joy unmeasured,

Life redeemed from death and sin.

God has spoken;

Praise Him For His open Word
