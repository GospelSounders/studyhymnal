# 1

I need Thee precious Jesus, for I am very poor;

A stranger and a pilgrim, I have no earthly store.

I need the love of Jesus to cheer me on my way,

To guide my doubting foot steps, to be my strength and stay.



# 2

I need the heart of Jesus to feel each anxious care,

To tell my every trial, and all my sorrows share.

I need the Holy Spirit to teach me what I am,

To show me more of Jesus, to point me to the Lamb.



# 3

I need Thee precious Jesus, I hope to see Thee soon,

Encircled with the rainbow, and seated on Thy throne.

There with Thy blood-bought children, my joy shall ever be

To sing Thy ceaseless praises, to gaze, my Lord, on Thee.
