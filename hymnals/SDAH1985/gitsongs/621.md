# 1

Gracious Father, guard Thy children

From the foe’s destructive power;

Save, O save them, Lord, from falling

In this dark and trying hour.

Thou wilt surely prove Thy people,

All our graces must be tried;

But Thy word illumes our pathway,

And in God we still confide.



# 2

We are in the time of waiting;

Soon we shall behold our Lord,

Wafted far away from sorrow,

To receive our rich reward.

Keep us, Lord, till Thine appearing,

Pure, unspotted from the world;

Let Thy Holy Spirit cheer us

Till Thy banner is unfurled.



# 3

With what joyful exultation

Shall the saints Thy banner see,

When the Lord for whom we’ve waited

Shall proclaim the jubilee!

Freedom from this world’s pollutions;

Freedom from all sin and pain;

Freedom from the wiles of Satan,

And from death’s destructive reign.
