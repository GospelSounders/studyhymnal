# 1

Buried beneath the yielding wave

The great Redeemer lies;

Faith views him in the watery grave,

And thence beholds him rise.



# 2

Thus do these willing souls today

Their ardent zeal express,

And in the Lord's appointed way

Fulfill all righteousness.



# 3

With joy we in his footsteps tread,

And would his cause maintain;

Like him be numbered with the dead,

And with him rise and reign.
