1.

Lamp of our feet, Whereby we trace

Our path when wont to stray;

Stream from the Fount of heav'nly grace;

Brook by the trav'ler's way;



2.

Bread of our souls, Whereon we feed;

True manna from on high;

Our guide and chart, wherein we read

Of realms beyond the sky;



3.

Pillar of fire thro' watches dark,

And radiant cloud by day;

When waves would whelm our tossing bark,

Our anchor and our stay;



4.

Word of the everlasting God;

Will of his glorious Son,

Without thee how could earth be trod,

Or heav'n itself be won?
