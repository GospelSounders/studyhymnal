# 1

More about Jesus, I would know,

More of His grace to others show;

More of His saving fullness see,

More of His love who died for me.



# Refrain

More, more about Jesus,

More, more about Jesus;

More of His saving fullness see,

More of His love who died for me.



# 2

More about Jesus, let me learn,

More of His holy will discern;

Spirit of God, my teacher be,

Showing the things of Christ to me.



# 3

More about Jesus, in His word,

Holding communion with my Lord;

Hearing His voice in every line,

Making each faithful saying mine.



# 4

More about Jesus, on His throne,

Riches in glory all His own;

More of His kingdom’s sure increase,

More of His coming, Prince of Peace.
