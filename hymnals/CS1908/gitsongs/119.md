# 1

Forgive, O Lord, the doubts that break

Thy promises to me;

Forgive me that I fail to take 

My pardon, full and free.

I sought to put my sins away,

I strove to do Thy will,

And yet, whene'er I tried to pray,

My heart was doubting still.



# 2

I tho't that Thou with jealous eyes

Wast watching me alway,

My deeds to mark, my steps to spy,

Whene'er I went astray;

I hoped that when, by days and years

Of service and of prayer,

I had besought Thy grace with tears,

Thy mercy I might share.



# 3

Forgive, O Father, this my sin,

This jealous, doubting heart;

For when men seek Thy love to win,

And choose the better part,

I know that, swifter than the light

Leaps earthward from the sun,

Thy pard'ning love,

Thy rescuing might,

Speed down to ev'ry one.
