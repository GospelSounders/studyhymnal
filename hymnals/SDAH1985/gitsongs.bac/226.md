# 1

Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates!

Behold the King of glory waits;

The King of kings is drawing near,

The Savior of the world is here.



# 2

The Lord is just, a helper tried;

Mercy is ever at His side;

His kingly crowns is holiness,

His scepter, pity in distress.



# 3

O blest the land, the city blest,

Where Christ the Ruler is confessed!

O happy hearts and happy homes

To whom this King in triumph comes!



# 4

Fling wide the portals of your heart;

Make it a temple, set apart

From earthly use for heaven’s employ,

Adorned with prayer, and love, and joy.



# 5

Redeemer, come; I open wide

My heart to Thee; here, Lord, abide.

Let me Thy inner presence feel,

Thy grace and love in me reveal.
