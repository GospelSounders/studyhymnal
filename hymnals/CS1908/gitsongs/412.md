# 1

O Lord, who hidest all our shame

Beneath thy crimsoned hand,

We feel thy touch, we trust thy name,

We yield to thy command.



# 2

We had no courage in the strife,

No shelter in retreat;

But thou hast glorified our life,

We lay it at thy feet.



# 3

Be thou our King our hearts are thine

Do with us as thou wilt,

So nevermore thy love divine

Be wounded for our guilt.



# 4

We ask no ease nor joyous hours

To use for self alone;

Take thou our thoughts, our ransomed pow'rs,

And make them all thine own.
