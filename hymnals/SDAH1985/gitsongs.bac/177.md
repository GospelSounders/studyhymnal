# 1

Jesus, your blood and righteousness

My beauty are, my glorious dress;

Mid flaming worlds, in these arrayed,

With joy shall I lift up my head.



# 2

Bold shall I stand in that great day,

Cleansed and redeemed, no debt to pay;

For by your cross absolved I am

From sin and guilt, from fear and shame.



# 3

Lord, I believe your precious blood,

Which at the mercy seat of God

Pleads for the captives’ liberty,

Was also shed in love for me.



# 4

When from the dust of death I rise

To claim my mansion in the skies,

This then shall be my only plea:

Christ Jesus lived and died for me.
