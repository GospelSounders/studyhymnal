# 1

Jesus, with Thy church abide;

Be her Savior, Lord, and Guide,

While on earth her faith is tried:

We beseech Thee, hear us.



# 2

May her voice be ever clear,

Warning of a judgment near,

Telling of a Savior dear:

We beseech Thee, hear us.



# 3

May she guide the poor and blind,

Seek the lost until she find,

And the broken hearted bind:

We beseech Thee, hear us.



# 4

May she holy triumps win,

Overthrow the hosts of sin,

Gather all the nations in:

We beseech Thee, hear us.
