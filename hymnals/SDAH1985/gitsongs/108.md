# 1

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound

that saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost, but now am found;

was blind, but now I see.



# 2

‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,

and grace my fears relieved;

how precious did that grace appear

the hour I first believed.



# 3

The Lord has promised good to me,

his word my hope secures;

he will my shield and portion be,

as long as life endures.



# 4

Through many dangers, toils, and snares,

I have already come;

’tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,

and grace will lead me home.



# 5

When we’ve been there ten thousand years,

bright shining as the sun,

we’ve no less days to sing God’s praise

than when we first begun.
