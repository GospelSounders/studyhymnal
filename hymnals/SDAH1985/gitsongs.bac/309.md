# 1

All to Jesus I surrender;

all to him I freely give;

I will ever love and trust him,

in his presence daily live.



# Refrain

I surrender all, I surrender all,

all to thee, my blessed Savior,

I surrender all.



# 2

All to Jesus I surrender;

humbly at his feet I bow,

worldly pleasures all forsaken;

take me, Jesus, take me now.



# 3

All to Jesus I surrender;

make me, Savior, wholly thine;

fill me with thy love and power;

truly know that thou art mine.



# 4

All to Jesus I surrender;

now I feel the sacred flame.

O the joy of full salvation!

Glory, glory, to his name!
