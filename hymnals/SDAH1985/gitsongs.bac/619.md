# 1

Lead on, O King eternal,

the day of march has come;

henceforth in fields of conquest

thy tents shall be our home.

Through days of preparation

thy grace has made us strong;

and now, O King eternal,

we lift our battle song.



# 2

Lead on, O King eternal,

till sin’s fierce war shall cease,

and holiness shall whisper

the sweet amen of peace.

For not with swords loud clashing,

nor roll of stirring drums;

with deeds of love and mercy

the heavenly kingdom comes.



# 3

Lead on, O King eternal,

we follow, not with fears,

for gladness breaks like morning

where’er thy face appears.

Thy cross is lifted o’er us,

we journey in its light;

the crown awaits the conquest;

lead on, O God of might.
