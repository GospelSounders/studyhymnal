# 1

The King shall come when morning dawns

And light triumphant breaks,

When beauty gilds the eastern hills

And life to joy awakes.



# 2

Not as of old a little child,

To bear and fight and die,

But crowned with glory like the sun

That lights the morning sky.



# 3

O, brighter than that rising morn

When Christ, victorious, rose

And left the lonesome place death,

Despite the rage of foes.



# 4

O, brighter than that glorious morn

Shall dawn upon our race

They day when Christ in splendour comes,

And we shall see His face.



# 5

The King shall come when morning dawns

And light and beauty brings.

Hail, Christ the Lord! Your people pray:

Come quickly, King of kings.
