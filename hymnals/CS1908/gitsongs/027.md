# 1

Would you be free from your burden of sin?

There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;

Would you o'er evil a victory win?

There's wonderful pow'r in the blood.



Chorus:

There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r

in the blood of the Lamb;

There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r

In the precious blood of the Lamb.



# 2

Would you be free from your passion and pride?

There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;

Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide,

There's wonderful pow'r in the blood [Chorus]



# 3

Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?

There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;

Sin stains are lost in its life-giving flow,

There's wonderful pow'r in the blood.  [Chorus]



# 4

Would you do service for Jesus your King?

There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;

Would you live daily His praises to sing?

There's wonderful pow'r in the blood.  [Chorus]
