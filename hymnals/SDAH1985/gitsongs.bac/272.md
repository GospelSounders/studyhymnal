# 1

Give me the Bible,

star of gladness gleaming,

To cheer the wanderer

lone and tempest tossed,

No storm can hide that

peaceful radiance beaming

Since Jesus came

to seek and save the lost.



# Refrain

Give me the Bible–

holy message shining,

Thy light shall guide me

in the narrow way.

Precept and promise,

law and love combining,

‘Til night shall vanish

in eternal day.



# 2

Give me the Bible

when my heart is broken,

When sin and grief have

filled my soul with fear,

Give me the precious

words by Jesus spoken,

Hold up faith’s lamp

to show my Savior near.



# 3

Give me the Bible,

all my steps enlighten,

Teach me the danger

of these realms below,

That lamp of safety,

o’er the gloom shall brighten,

That light alone

the path of peace can show.
