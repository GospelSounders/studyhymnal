# 1

Closer to thee, my Father, draw me,

I long for thine embrace;

Closer within thine arms enfold me,

I seek a resting place.



Chorus:

Closer with the cords of love,

Draw me to thyself above;

Closer draw me, 

To thyself above.



# 2

Closer to thee, my Saviour, draw me,

Nor let me leave thee more;

Fain would I feel thine arms around me,

And count my wand'rings o'er.  [Chorus]



# 3

Closer by thy sweet Spirit draw me,

Till I am all like thee;

Quicken, refine, and wash and cleanse me,

Till I am pure and free.  [Chorus]
