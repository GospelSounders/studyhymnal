# 1

Tell it to every kindred and nation,

Tell it far and near;

Earth’s darkest night will fade with the dawning,

Jesus will soon appear.



# Refrain

Hail Him the King of glory,

Once the Lamb for sinners slain;

Tell, tell the wondrous story,

“Jesus comes to reign.”



# 2

Nations again in strife and commotion,

Warnings by the way;

Signs in the heavens, unerring omens,

Herald the glorious day.



# 3

Children of God look up with rejoicing;

Shout and sing His praise;

Blessèd are they who, waiting and watching,

Look for the dawning rays.
