# 1

Hark! ’tis the Shepherd’s voice I hear,

Out in the desert dark and drear,

Calling the sheep who’ve gone astray,

Far from the Shepherd’s fold away.



# Refrain

Bring them in, Bring them in,

Bring them in from the fields of sin;

Bring them in, Bring them in,

Bring the wanderers to Jesus.



# 2

Who’ll go and help the Shepherd kind,

Help Him the wandering ones to find?

Who’ll bring them back into the fold,

Where they’ll be sheltered from the cold?



# 3

Out in the desert hear their cry,

Out on the mountain wild and high,

Hark! ’tis the Master speaks to thee,

“Go, find My sheep where ‘er they be.”
