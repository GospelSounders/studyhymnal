1.

Unshaken as the sacred hills,

And fix'd as mountains stand;

Firm as a rock the soul shall rest

That trusts th' Almighty hand.



2.

Not walls nor hills could guard so well

Fair Salem's happy ground,

As these eternal arms of love

That ev'ry saint surround.



3.

Do good, O Lord, do good to those

Who cleave to thee in heart,

Who on thy truth alone repose,

Nor from thy law depart.
