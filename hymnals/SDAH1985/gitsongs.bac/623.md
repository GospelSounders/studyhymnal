# 1

I will follow Thee, my Savior,

Wheresoe’er my lot may be.

Where thou goest I will follow;

Yes, my Lord, I’ll follow Thee.



# Refrain

I will follow Thee, my Saviour,

Thou didst shed Thy blood for me;

And though all men should forsake Thee;

By Thy grace I’ll follow Thee.



# 2

Though the road be rough and thorny,

Trackless as the foaming sea,

Thou hast trod this way before me,

And I’ll gladly follow Thee.



# 3

Though I meet with tribulations,

Sorely tempted though I be;

I remember Thou wast tempted,

And rejoice to follow Thee.



# 4

Though Thou leadest me through affliction,

Poor, forsaken though I be;

Thou wast destitute, afflicted,

And I only follow Thee.



# 5

Though to Jordan’s rolling billows,

Cold and deep, Thou leadest me,

Thou hast crossed the waves before me,

And I still will follow Thee.
