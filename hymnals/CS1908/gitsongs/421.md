# 1

This is the day of rest;

Our failing strength renew;

On weary brain and troubled breast

Shed thou thy fresh'ning dew.



# 2

This is the day of peace;

Thy peace our spirits fill;

Bid thou the blasts of discord cease,

The waves of strife be still.



# 3

This is the day of pray'r;

Let earth to heav'n draw near;

Lift up our hearts to seek there;

Come down to meet us here.



# 4

This is the best of days;

Send forth thy quick'ning breath,

And wake dead souls to love and praise,

O Vanquisher of death!
