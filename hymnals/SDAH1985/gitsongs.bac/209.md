# 1

That glorious day is coming,

The hour is hastening on;

Its radiant light is nearing,

Far brighter than the sun;

In yonder clouds of heaven,

The Saviour will appear,

And gather all His chosen,

To meet Him in the air.

The saints, then all victorious

Will go to meet their Lord;

An earth both bright and glorious,

Will then be their reward;

And God Himself there reigning,

Will wipe all tears away;

Nor clouds nor night remaining,

But one eternal day.



# 2

O Christian, keep from sleeping,

And let your love abound;

Be watchful, prayerful, faithful,

The trumpet soon will sound!

O sinner, hear the warning!

To Jesus quickly fly!

Then you, in that blest morning,

May meet Him in the sky!
