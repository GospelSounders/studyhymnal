# 1

God Himself is with us;

Let us all adore Him,

And with awe appear before Him.

God is here within us;

Soul, in silence fear Him,

Humbly, fervently draw near Him.

Now His own who have known God,

In worship lowly,

Yield their spirits wholly.



# 2

Come, abide within me;

Let my soul, like Mary,

Be Thine earthly sanctuary.

Come, indwelling Spirit,

With transfigured splendor;

Love and honor will I render.

Where I go here below,

Let me bow before Thee,

Know Thee and adore Thee.



# 3

Gladly we surrender

Earth’s deceitful treasures,

Pride of life and sinful pleasures:

Gladly, Lord, we offer

Thine to be forever,

Soul and life and each endeavor.

Thou alone shall be known

Lord of all our being,

Life’s true way decreeing.
