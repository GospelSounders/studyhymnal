# 1

Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish;

Come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel;

Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;

Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.



# 2

Joy of the comfortless, light of the straying,

Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure;

Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,

"Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure."



# 3

Here see the Bread of Life, see waters flowing

Forth from the throne of God, pure from above;

Come to the feast of love, come ever knowing

Earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove.
