# 1

Answer the call, ye brave men,

The Master's call to save men;

Each moment death is gaining,

Their blood our garments staining:



Chorus:

Who'll go?  who'll go, whate'er the cost?

Who'll go?  who'll go to save the lost?



# 2

Lighting the world with glory,

Once more the gospel story

In purity and pow'r

Proclaims the judgment hour:  [Chorus]



# 3

Nations afar are waking,

Their idol shrines forsaking;

God's truth puts on its splendor,

Immanuel its defender:  [Chorus]



# 4

Bearing the name of Jesus,

Whose great salvation frees us,

With joy the good news carry, 

Nor dare to longer tarry:  [Chorus]



# 5

Where icy winds are crying,

Where India's poor are dying,

Where Southern seas are sleeping,

Where Western isles are weeping.  



Chorus:  I go, I go, whate'er the cost;

I go, I go to save the lost.
