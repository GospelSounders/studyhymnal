# 1

"My times are in thy hand:"

My God, I wish them there;

My life, my friends, my all I leave

Entirely to thy care.



# 2

"My times are in thy hand:"

Why should I doubt or fear?

My Father's hand will never cause

His child a needless tear.



# 3

"My times are in thy hand;"

I'll always trust in thee,

Till I possess the promised land,

And all thy glory see.
