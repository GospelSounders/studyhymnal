# 1

O Saviour, precious Saviour,

Whom yet unseen we love,

O Name of might and favor,

All other names above!

We worship Thee, we bless Thee,

To thee, O Christ, we sing;

We praise thee, and confess Thee

Our holy Lord and King.



# 2

O bringer of salvation,

Who wondrously hast wrought,

Thyself the revelation 

Of love beyond our tho't,

We worship Thee, we bless Thee,

To Thee, O Christ, we sing;

We praise Thee, and confess Thee

Our gracious Lord and King.



# 3

In Thee all fulness dwelleth,

All grace and pow'r divine;

The glory that excelleth,

O Son of God is Thine;

We worship Thee, we bless thee,

To thee, O Christ, we sing;

We praise Thee, and confess Thee

Our glorious Lord and King.



# 4

Oh, grant the consummation

Of this our song above,

In endless adoration,

And everlasting love;

Then shall we praise and bless Thee

Where perfect praises ring,

And evermore confess Thee

Our Saviour and our King.
