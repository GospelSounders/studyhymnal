# 1

Under His wings I am safely abiding;

Tho' the night deepens and tempests are wild,

Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;

He has redeemed me, and I am His child.



Chorus:

Under His wings, under His wings,

Who from His love can sever?

Under His wings my soul shall abide,

Safely abide forever.



# 2

Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!

How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!

Often when earth has no balm for my healing,

There I find comfort, and there I am blest.  [Chorus]



# 3

Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!

There will I hide till life's trials are o'er;

Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;

Resting in Jesus I'm safe ever more.  [Chorus]
