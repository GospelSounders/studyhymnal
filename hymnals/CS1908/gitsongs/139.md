# 1

Chief of sinners tho' I be,

Jesus shed his blood for me,

Died that I might live on high,

Died that I might never die;

As the branch is to the vine,

I am his, and he is mine.



# 2

O the height of Jesus' love!

Higher than the heav'n above,

Deeper than the deepest sea,

Lasting as eternity;

Love that found me wondrous tho't!

Found me when I sought him not.



# 3

Chief of sinners tho' I be,

Christ is all in all to me;

All my wants to him are known,

All my sorrows are his own;

Safe with him from earthly strife,

He sustains the hidden life.
