# 1

The Lord my pasture shall prepare,

And feed me with a shepherd's care;

His presence shall my wants supply,

And guard me with a watchful eye;

My noonday walks he shall attend,

And all my midnight hours defend.



# 2

When on the sultry globe I faint,

Or, on the thirsty mountain pant,

To fertile vales and dewy meads

My weary, wand'ring steps he leads

Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,

Amid the verdant landscape flow.



# 3

Tho' in the paths of death I tread,

With gloomy horrors overspread,

My steadfast heart shall fear no ill,

For thou, O Lord, art with me still;

Thy friendly staff shall give me aid,

And guide me thro' the dreadful shade.



Amen.
