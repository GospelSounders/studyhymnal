# 1

Knocking, knocking, who is there?

Waiting, waiting, O how fair!

'Tis a Pilgrim, strange and kingly,

Never such was seen before;

Ah!  my soul, for such a wonder

Wilt thou not undo the door?

Wilt thou not undo the door?



# 2

Knocking, knocking, still He's there,

Waiting, waiting, wondrous fair;

But the door is hard to open,

For the weeds and ivy vine

With their dark and clinging tendrils

Ever round the hinges twice,

Ever round the hinges twice.



# 3

Knocking, knocking what!  still there?

Waiting, waiting, grand and fair;

Yea, the wounded hand still knocketh,

And beneath the thorn-wreath'd hair

Beam the patient eyes, so tender,

Of thy Savior waiting there;

Wilt thou keep him waiting there?
