# 1

Hallelujahs to Jesus! 

Hallelujahs forever!

His wondrous salvation our tongues shall declare.

Sound the life invitation,

Call the glad coronation;

The Lord of creation the crown shall wear.



# 2

Strike the cymbals of gladness,

Hush the lone harps of sadness;

He lives who redeemed us from death's awful gloom.

Tell the wonderful story,

From the manger to glory;

All hail to King Jesus who burst the tomb!



# 3

With the angels uniting,

In his praises delighting,

Both here and in heav'n shall our joy anthem ring.

For his love ever vernal,

For his mercy eternal, 

Let glory supernal crown Jesus Christ.
