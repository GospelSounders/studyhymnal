# 1

 The great decisive day is at hand, is at hand!

The great decisive day is at hand;

The day when Christ will come,

To call his children home,

And to seal the sinner's doom, is at hand, is at hand;

And to seal the sinner's doom, is at hand.



# 2

Those who made his crown of thorns will be there, will be there!

Those who made his crown of thorns will be there!

Those who smote him with the reed 

Upon his sacred head,

And made his temples bleed, will be there, will be there;

And made his temples bleed, will be there.



# 3

Where will the sinner hide in that day, in that day?

Where will the sinner hide in that day?

It will be in vain to call, 

"Ye mountains on us fall,"

For his hand will find out all  In that day, in that day;

For his hand will find out all in that day.
