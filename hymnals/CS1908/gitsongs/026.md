# 1

A ruler once came to Jesus by night,

To ask Him the way of salvation and light;

The Master made answer in words true and plain,

"Ye must be born again."



Chorus:

"Ye must be born again,

Ye must be born again,

I verily, verily, say unto thee,

Ye must be born again.



# 2

Ye children of men, attend to the word

So solemnly uttered by Jesus the Lord,

And let not this message to you be in vain,

"Ye must be born again." [Chorus]



# 3

O ye who would enter that glorious rest,

And sing with the ransom'd the song of the blest,

The life everlasting if you would obtain,

"Ye must be born again."  [Chorus]
