# 1

Once our blessed Christ of beauty

Was veiled off from human views;

But through suffering, death, and sorrow

He has rent the veil in two.



# Refrain

O behold the Man of Sorrows!

O behold Him in plain view!

Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror

Since her rent the veil in two;

Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror

Since her rent the veil in two.



# 2

Yes, He is with God, the Father,

Interceding there for you;

For He is the Well beloved

Since He rent the veil in two.



# 3

Holy angels bow before Him,

Men of earth give praises due;

For He is the mighty Conqueror

Since He rent the veil in two.
