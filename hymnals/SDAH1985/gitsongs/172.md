Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!



# 1

The strife is o’er, the battle done;

Now is the victor’s triumph won!

Now be the song of praise begun. Alleluia!



# 2

The pow’rs of death have done their worst,

But Christ their legions has dispersed.

Let shouts of holy joy outburst. Alleluia!



# 3

The three sad days have quickly sped,

He rises glorious from the dead.

All glory to our risen head! Alleluia!



# 4

Lord, by the stripes which wounded You,

From death’s sting free Your servants too,

That we may live and sing to You. Alleluia!
