# 1

The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want.

He makes me down to lie

In pastures green; He leadeth me

The quiet waters by.



# 2

My soul He doth restore again.

And me to walk doth make

Within the paths of righteousness,

E’en for His own name’s sake.



# 3

Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale,

Yet will I fear no ill,

For Thou art with me; and Thy rod

And staff me comfort still.



# 4

My table Thou hast furnished

In presence of my foes;

My head Thou dost with oil anoint,

And my cup overflows.



# 5

Goodness and mercy all my life

Shall surely follow me;

And in God’s house forevermore

My dwelling place shall be.
