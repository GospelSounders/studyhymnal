569 â€“ Little Feet, Be Careful


1
I wash'd my hands this morning,
O very clean and white,
And lent them both to Jesus,
To work for him till night.

Chorus:
Little feet, be careful,
Where you take me to,
Anything for Jesus,
Only let me do.

2
I told my ears to listen
Quite closely all day thro',
For any act of kindness,
Such little hands can do.  [Chorus]

3
My eyes are set to watch them
About their work or play,
To keep them out of mischief,
For Jesus' sake all day.  [Chorus]
