# 1

Now all the woods are sleeping,

And night and stillness creeping

O’er city, man, and beast;

But thou, my heart, awake thee,

To pray’r awhile be take thee,

And praise thy Maker ere thou rest.



# 2

My Jesus, stay Thou by me,

And let no foe come nigh me,

Safe sheltered by Thy wing;

But would the foe alarm me,

O let him never harm me,

But still Thine angels round me sing!



# 3

My loved ones, rest securely,

From every peril surely

Our God will guard your heads;

And happy slumbers send you,

And bid His hosts attend you,

And golden armed watch o’er your beds.
