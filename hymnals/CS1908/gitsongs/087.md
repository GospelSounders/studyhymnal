# 1

Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,

Hear my humble cry,

While on others Thou art calling,

Do not pass me by.



Chorus:

Saviour, Saviour,

hear my humble cry,

While on others Thou art calling,

Do not pass me by.



# 2

Let me at the throne of mercy

Find a sweet relief;

Kneeling there in deep contrition,

Help my unbelief.  [Chorus]



# 3

Trusting only in Thy merit,

Would I seek Thy face;

Heal my wounded, broken spirit,

Save me by Thy grace?  [Chorus]



# 4

Thou the Spring of all my comfort,

More than life to me;

Whom have I on earth beside thee!

Whom in heav'n but Thee?  [Chorus]
