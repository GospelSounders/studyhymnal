# 1

As water to the thirsty,

As beauty to the eyes,

As strength that follows weakness,

As truth instead of lies;

As song-time and springtime and summertime to be,

So is my Lord, my living Lord,

So is my Lord to me.



# 2

Like calm in place of clamor

Like peace that follows pain,

Like meeting after parting,

Like sunshine after rain;

Like moonlight and starlight and sunlight on the sea,

So is my Lord, my living Lord,

So is my Lord to me.



# 3

As sleep that follows fever,

As gold instead of grey,

As freedom after bondage,

As sunrise to the day;

As home to the trav’ler and all he longs to see,

So is my Lord, my living Lord,

So is my Lord to me.
