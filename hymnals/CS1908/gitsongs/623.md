# 1

For Christ is our endeavor,

Our hearts to Him belong;

His presence cheers us ever,

His love inspires our song;

We come in youth's bright morning,

Obedient to His word,

And seek for our adorning,

The beauty of the Lord.



# 2

In fulness of His blessing,

Good work for Him we'll do;

His name with joy confessing,

His standard bearers true;

And He will never fail us,

Whatever may betide;

Tho' danger should assail us,

In Him we safe abide.



# 3

So with youth's ardor showing,

We form a Christian band;

The mind of Jesus knowing,

We for His honor stand;

For He is our Endeavor,

And to Him we belong,

Whose grace shall fail us never,

Whose love inspires our song.
