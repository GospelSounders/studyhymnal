# 1

Another six days' work is done,

Another Sabbath is begun;

Return, my soul, enjoy thy rest,

Improve the day that God has blessed.



# 2

Come, bless the Lord, whose love assigns

So sweet a rest to weary minds;

A blessed antepast is giv'n,

On this day more than all the sev'n.



# 3

O that our thoughts and thanks may rise

As grateful incense to the skies,

And draw from Christ that sweet repose

Which none but he who feels it knows.



# 4

This heav'nly calm within the breast

Is the best pledge of glorious rest,

Which for the church of God remains,

The end of cares, the end of pains.
