# 1

In the cross of Christ I glory,

Towering o'er the wrecks of time,

All the light of sacred story,

Gathers round its head sublime.



# 2

When the woes of life o'ertake me,

Hopes deceive and fears annoy,

Never shall the cross forsake me;

Lo!  it glows with peace and joy.



# 3

When the sun of bliss is beaming

Light and love upon my way,

From the cross the radiance streaming,

Adds new luster to the sky.



# 4

Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,

By the cross are sanctified;

Peace is there, that knows no measure, 

Joys that through all time abide.
