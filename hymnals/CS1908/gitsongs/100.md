# 1

Crowded is your heart with cares,

Have you no room for Jesus:

Captured by earth's golden snares,

Have you no room for Jesus?

Lo!  he's standing at your door,

Knocking, knocking o'er and o'er;

Hear him pleading evermore;

Have you no room for Jesus?



# 2

Wasting all your precious hours,

Have you no work for Jesus?

Spending these God-given pow'rs,

Have you no work for Jesus?

Striving not to conquer sin,

Seeking not a soul to win,

Bringing not a wand'rer in;

Have you no work for Jesus?



# 3

Seeking earth's possessions fair,

Have you no time for Jesus?

None for gracious deeds to spare,

Have you no time for Jesus?

Not a grain to store away,

Naught your labor to replay,

Not a joy for that great day

When you shall meet with Jesus.



# 4

Bearing only worthless leaves,

Have you no fruit for Jesus?

In your hands no precious sheaves,

Have you no fruit for Jesus?

Not a grain to store away,

Naught your labor to repay,

Not a joy for that great day

When you shall meet with Jesus.
