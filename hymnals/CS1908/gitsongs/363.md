# 1

A glory gilds the sacred page,

Majestic, like the sun;

It gives a light to every age,

It gives, but borrows none.

It gives, but borrows none.



# 2

The Spirit breathes upon the word,

And brings the truth to sight;

Precepts and promises afford

A sanctifying light.

A sanctifying light.



# 3

The hand that gave it, still supplies

The gracious light and heat;

His truths upon the nations rise,

They rise, but never set.

They rise, but never set.



# 4

Let everlasting thanks be thine,

For such a bright display;

It makes a world of darkness shine

With beams of heav'nly day.

With beams of heav'nly day.
