# 1

O God our help in ages past,

Our hope for years to come;

Our shelter from the stormy blast,

And our eternal home!



# 2

Under the shadow of Thy throne

Thy saints have dwelt secure;

Sufficient in thine arm alone,

And our defence is sure.



# 3

Before the hills in order stood,

Or earth received her frame,

From everlasting Thou art God,

To endless years the same.



# 4

A thousand ages, in Thy sight, 

Are like an ev'ning gone;

Short as the watch that ends the night,

Before the rising sun.
