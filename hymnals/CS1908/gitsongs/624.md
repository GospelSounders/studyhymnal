# 1

From Greenland's icy mountains,

From India's coral strand,

Where Afric's sunny fountains

Roll down their golden sand,

From many an ancient river,

From many a palmy plain,

They call us to deliver

Their land from error's chain.



# 2

What tho' the spicy breezes

Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle;

Tho' ev'ry prospect pleases,

And only man is vile;

In vain with lavish kindness

The gifts of God are strown;

The heathen in his blindness,

Bows down to wood and stone.  



# 3

Shall we whose souls are lighted,

With wisdom from on high,

Shall we to men benighted,

The lamp of life deny?

Salvation, O salvation!

The joyful sound proclaim

Till earth's remotest nation

Has heard Messiah's name.



# 4

Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,

Ye waters, onward roll,

Till, like a sea of glory,

It spreads from pole to pole;

Till o'er our ransomed nature

The Lamb for sinners slain

Redeemer, King, Creator--

In bliss returns to reign.
