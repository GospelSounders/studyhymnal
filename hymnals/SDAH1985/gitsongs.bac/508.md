# 1

Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,

Anywhere He leads me in this world below;

Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;

Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.



# Refrain

Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;

Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.



# 2

Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;

Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;

Though His hand may lead me over drearest ways,

Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.



# 3

Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,

When the darkening shadows round about me creep,

Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;

Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
