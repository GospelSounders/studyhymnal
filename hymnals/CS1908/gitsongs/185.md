# 1

Must Jesus bear the cross alone,

And all the world go free?

No, there's a cross for ev'ry one,

And there's a cross for me.



# 2

The consecrated cross 'll bear,

Till He shall set me free;

And then go home my crown to wear,

For there's a crown for me.



# 3

Upon the crystal pavement, down

At Jesus' pierced feet,

With joy I'll cast my golden crown,

And his dear name repeat.
