# 1

Heir of the kingdom, O why dost thou slumber?

Why art thou sleeping so near thy blest home?

Wake thee, arouse thee, and gird on thine armor,

Speed, for the moments are hurrying on.



# 2

Heir of the kingdom, say, why dost thou linger?

How canst thou tarry in sight of the prize?

Up, and adorn thee, the Savior is coming;

Haste to receive Him descending the skies.



# 3

Earth’s mighty nations, in strife and commotion,

Tremble with terror, and sink in dismay;

Listen, ’tis nought but the chariot’s loud rumbling;

Heir of the kingdom, no longer delay.



# 4

Stay not, O stay not for earth’s vain allurements!

See how its glory is passing away;

Break the strong fetters the foe hath bound o’er thee;

Heir of the kingdom, turn, turn thee away.



# 5

Keep the eye single, the head upward lifted;

Watch for the glory of earth’s coming King;

Lo! o’er the mountaintops light is now breaking;

Heirs of the kingdom, rejoice ye and sing.
