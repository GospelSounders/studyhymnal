# 1

Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam.

Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home!

A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,

Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.



Refrain:

Home, home, sweet, sweet home;

Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.



# 2

An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain,

O give me my lowly thatched cottage again;

The birds singing gaily, that came at my call,

And with them, God's peace, which is dearer than all.  [Refrain]
