# 1

Welcome, delightful morning,

Thou day of sacred rest;

I hail thy kind return;

Lord, make these moments blest.

From the low train of mortal toys

I soar to reach immortal joys,

I sour to reach immortal joys.



# 2

Now may the King descend,

And fill his throne of grace;

Thy scepter, Lord, extend,

While saints address thy face;

Let sinners feel thy quick'ning word,

And learn to know and fear the Lord.



# 3

Descend, celestial Dove,

With all thy quick'ning pow'rs;

Disclose a Saviour's love,

And bless these sacred hours;

Then shall my soul new life obtain,

Nor Sabbath-days be passed in vain.
