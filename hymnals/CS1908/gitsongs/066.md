# 1

Yield not to temptation,

For yielding is sin,

Each vict'ry will help you

Some other to win;

Fight manfully onward,

Dark passions subdue.

Look ever to Jesus,

He'll carry you through.



Chorus:

Ask the Saviour to help you,

Comfort, strengthen, and keep you;

He is willing to aid you,

He will carry you through.



# 2

Shun evil companions,

Bad language disdain,

God's name hold in rev'rence,

Nor take it in vain;

Be thoughtful and earnest,

Kindhearted and true,

Look ever to Jesus, 

He'll carry you through.  [Chorus]



# 3

To him that o'ercometh,

God giveth a crown,

Through faith we shall conquer,

Tho' often cast down;

He who is our Saviour,

Our strength will renew.

Look ever to Jesus,

He'll carry you through.  [Chorus]
