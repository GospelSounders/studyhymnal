# 1

You that know the Lord is gracious,

You for whom a cornerstone

Stands, of God elect and precious,

Laid that you may build there-on,

See that on that sure foundation

You a living temple raise.

Towers that may tell forth salvation,

Walls that may reech-o praise.



# 2

Living stones by God appointed

Each to his allotted place,

Kings and priests, by God anointed,

Shall you not declare His grace?

You, a royal generation,

Tell the tidings of your birth,

Tidings of a new creation

To an old and weary earth.



# 3

Tell the praise of Him who called you

Out of darkness into light,

Broke the fetters that enthralled you,

Gave you freedom, peace, and sight:

Tell the tale of sins forgiven,

Strength renewed and hope restored,

Till the earth, in tune with heaven,

Praise and magnify the Lord.
