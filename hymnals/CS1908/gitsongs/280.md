# 1

Welcome!  thrice welcome!

Ye loyal host of God,

Welcome!  thrice welcome!

From near and from abroad;

Tho' changing years pass swiftly by,

Our cause is still the same,

And thus we gladly greet you in

Our Master's conq'ring Name.



Chorus:

Welcome!  thrice welcome 

to homes and hearts and love;

Welcome!  thrice welcome!

And blessings from above.



# 2

Welcome!  thrice welcome!

Believers in the Lord;

Welcome!  thrice welcome!

Upholders of His word;

We meet our Saviour's name to praise,

To learn what He requires,

And by His Spirit's help resolve

To follow His desires.  [Chorus]



# 3

Welcome!  thrice welcome!

Be steadfast in the right,

Welcome!  thrice welcome!

Till faith is lost in sight;

And when our battles all are won

We'll join the blessed throng,

Then God will welcome us and we

Will hear heav'ns welcome song.  [Chorus]
