# 1

Give to the winds your fears;

In hope be undismayed:

God hears your sighs and coundts your tears,

God shall lift up your head.



# 2

To Him commit your griefs;

Your ways put in His hands

To His sure truth adn tender care

Who earth adn heave commands.



# 3

O put your trust in God;

In duty’s path go on.

Walk in His strength with faith and hope,

So shall your work be done.



# 4

Leave to His sovereign sway

To choose and to command;

So you shall, faithful, seek His way

how wise, how strong His hand!
