# 1

We'll tarry by the living waters,

The fountain pure and free;

There Jesus waits to give us welcome,

A welcome sweet 'twill be.



Chorus:

We'll tarry by the living waters,

Tarry by the living waters;

Tarry by the living waters,

Tarry by the Fount of Life.



# 2

When weary with the toilsome journey,

'Tis sweet to rest awhile

Where crystal waters gently murmur,

And sunny fountains smile.  [Chorus]



# 3

Then come to Christ, the living water,

Thy strength will he restore;

Come, taste the joy of his salvation,

And drink to thirst no more.  [Chorus]
