# 1

Oh now I see the crimson wave,

The fountain deep and wide;

Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,

Points to His wounded side.



# Refrain

The cleansing stream I see, I see,

I plunge, and O, it cleanseth me!

O praise the Lord! it cleanseth me,

It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.



# 2

I see the new creation rise,

I hear the speaking blood;

It speaks polluted nature dies,

Sinks ‘neath the cleansing flood.



# 3

I rise to walk in heaven’s own light,

Above the world and sin;

With heart made pure and garments white,

And Christ enthroned within.



# 4

Amazing grace! ’tis heaven below

To feel the blood applied,

And Jesus, only Jesus, know,

My Jesus crucified.
