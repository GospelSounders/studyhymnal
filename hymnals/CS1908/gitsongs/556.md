# 1

When softly fades the dying days,

And mortal cares we fold away,

Then with the last faint ray of light

All nature seems to say good night.



Refrain:

Good night, good night,

May angels bright,

Their vigils keep till morning light,

Good night, good night,

Good night, good night.



# 2

And when the deeper shadows fall,

And nature veil as with a pall,

Then pray'rs of evening take their flight

From lips that softly say good night.  [Refrain]



# 3

O Father, give us sweet repose

From all our earthly cares and woes,

And grant that heav'n may greet our sight

When we have said our last good night.  [Refrain]
