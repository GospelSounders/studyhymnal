# 1

The sacred anthem slowly rang

Across the fields of praise,

When earth’s first Sabbath made complete

All creatures and all days.



# 2

Walking with God, there,

Woman and man together share

The blessed Sabbath mood;

And in that green and golden world

Know all God’s works are good.



# 3

But now in our diminished lives

We sing a blemished song;

The earth is worn and disarrayed

And all our work goes wrong.



# 4

Still in our worship,

Joining in praise and fellowship,

By Sabbath radiance blessed,

We put our doubt and fear away

And rest within God’s rest.



# 5

And arching over time and space

The Lord of Sabbaths wills

Renewal for the weary earth

And healing for our ills.



# 6

Hearts will rejoice then;

There will be no more weeping, when

We know and shall be known.

With hosts of the redeemed we’ll sing

Around God’s shining throne.
