008 â€“ Jesus Is Calling


1
Jesus is tenderly calling thee home
Calling today, calling today;
Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam
Farther and farther away?

Refrain:
Calling today,
calling today;
Jesus is calling,
is tenderly calling today.

2
Jesus is calling the weary to rest
Calling today, calling today;
Bring Him thy burden, and thou shalt be blest;
He will not turn thee away.  [Refrain]

3
Jesus is waiting, oh, come to Him now
Waiting today, waiting today;
Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow;
Come, and no longer delay.  [Refrain]

4
Jesus is pleading, oh, list to His voice
Hear Him today,
hear Him to-day;
They who believ on His name shall rejoice;
Quickly arise and away.  [Refrain]
