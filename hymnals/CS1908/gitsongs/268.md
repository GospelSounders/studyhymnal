# 1

Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven,

To His feet thy tribute bring;

Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,

Who like thee His praise should sing?

Praise Him!  praise Him!

Praise Him!  praise Him!

Praise the everlasting King!



# 2

Praise, Him for His grace and favor

To our fathers in distress;

Praise Him, still the same forever,

Slow to chide, and swift to blest;

Praise Him!  praise Him!

Praise Him!  praise Him!

Praise the high eternal One!



# 3

Frail as summer's flow'r we flourish,

Blows the wind, and it is gone;

But, while mortals rise and perish,

God endures unchanging on.

Praise Him!  praise Him!

Praise Him!  praise Him!

Praise the high eternal One!



# 4

Angels, help us to adore Him;

Ye behold Him face to face;

Sun and moon, bow down before Him,

Dwellers all in time and space,

Praise Him!  praise Him!

Praise Him!  praise Him!  

Praise with us the God of grace!
