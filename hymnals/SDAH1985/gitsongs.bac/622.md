# 1

Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor labor fear;

But with joy wend your way.

Though hard to you the journey may appear,

Grace shall be as your day.

We will have a living lord to guide,

And we can trust Him to provide;

Do this, and joy your hearts will swell:All is well! All is well!



# 2

We’ll find the rest which God for us prepared,

When at last He will call;

Where none will come to hurt or make afraid,

He will reign over all.

We will make the air with music ring,

Shout praise to God our Lord and King:

O how we’ll make the chorus swell:

All is well! All is well!
