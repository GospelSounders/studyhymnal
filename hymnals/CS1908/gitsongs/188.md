# 1

God shall be first in ev'rything;

No other gods before him;

Creator and Redeemer King,

'Tis pleasure to adore him.



# 2

First when with rosy morn I wake,

His pow'r mine eyes unsealing;

First when his bounteous gifts I take,

His Father love revealing.



# 3

First when the crowding cares of day

Impatient press upon me;

First when the gentle twilight ray

With peaceful calm falls on me.



# 4

First when I leave mortality,

The glad new song upraising;

First all Eternity, where we

Shall dwell who here are praising.
