# 1

What heavenly music steals over the sea!

Entrancing the senses like sweet melody!

‘Tis the voice of the angels borne soft on the air;

For me they are singing; their welcome I hear.



# 2

On the banks of old Jordan, here gazing I stand,

And earnestly longing, I stretch forth my hand;

Send a convoy of angels, dear Jesus, I pray!

Let me join that sweet music; come, take me away.



# 3

Though dark are the waters and rough is the wave,

If Jesus permit, the wild surges I’ll brave;

For that heavenly music hath ravished me so,

I must join in that chorus! I’ll go! let me go!
