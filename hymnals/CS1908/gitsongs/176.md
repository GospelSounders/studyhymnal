# 1

Come, O thou Traveler unknown,

Whom still I bold, but can not see;

My company before is gone,

And I am left alone with thee;

With thee all night I mean to stay,

And wrestle till the break of day.



# 2

I need not tell thee who I am;

My sin and misery declare;

Thyself hast called me by my name,

Look on thy hands, and read it there;

But who, I ask thee, who art thou?

Tell me thy name, and tell me now.



# 3

In vain thou strugglest to get free;

I never will unloose my hold;

Art thou the Man that died for me?

The secret of thy love unfold;

Wrestling, I will not let thee go,

Till I thy name, thy nature know.
