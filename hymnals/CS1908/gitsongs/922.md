1.

When Jesus calls His jewels

From ev'ry land and sea,

And takes them home to glory,

What a meeting that will be!



Refrain:

We'll meet them in glory,

Meet them in glory,

Meet them in glory;

What a meeting that will be!



2.

We'll meet the friends departed,

The loved ones called away;

Not one will be forgotten

In the glad reunion day.  [Refrain]



3.

We'll meet the kings and prophets

Of ages long ago,

And all the faithful martyrs

Who bled for truth below.  [Refrain]



4.

We'll meet in all His beauty

The One whom we adore,

Who died that we, believing,

May live forevermore.  [Refrain]
