# 1

Brightly beams our Father's mercy,

From His lighthouse evermore,

But to us He gives the keeping

Of the lights along the shore.



Chorus:

Let the lower lights be burning!

Send a gleam across the wave!

Some poor fainting, struggling seaman

You may rescue, you may save.



# 2

Dark the night of sin has settled,

Loud the angry billows roar;

Eager eyes are watching, longing,

For the lights along the shore.  [Chorus]



# 3

Trim your feeble lamp, my brother

Some poor sailor tempest tost,

Trying now to make the harbor,

In the darkness may be lost.  [Chorus]
