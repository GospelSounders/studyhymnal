# 1

Does Jesus care when my heart is pained

Too deeply for mirth and song;

As the burdens press, and the cares distress,

And the way grows weary and long?



# Refrain

O yes, He cares- I know He cares!

His heart is touched with my grief;

When the days are weary,

The long nights dreary,

I know my Savior cares. (He cares.)



# 2

Does Jesus care when my way is dark

With a nameless dread and fear?

As the daylight fades into deep night shades,

Does He care enough to be near?



# 3

Does Jesus care when I’ve said goodbye

To the dearest on earth to me,

And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks ­

Is it aught to Him? Does He see?
