447 – The Rising Day


1
Once more, my soul, the rising day
Salutes thy waking eye;
Once more, my voice, thy tribute, pay
To Him who rules on high.

2
Night unto night His name repeats,
The day renews the sound,
Wide as the heav'ns on which He sits
To turn the seasons round.

3
O God, may all my hours be thine,
While I enjoy the light;
Then shall my sun in smiles decline,
And bring a peaceful night.
