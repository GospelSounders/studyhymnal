# 1

The advent of our God

With eager prayers we greet,

And singing haste upon His road

His coming reign to meet.



# 2

The everlasting Son

Was born to make us free;

And He a servant’s form put on

To gain our liberty.



# 3

As Judge, on clouds of light,

He soon will come again,

His scattered people to unite

With them in heaven to reign.



# 4

Praise to the incarnate Son

Who comes to set us free,

With Father, Spirit, ever one,

To all eternity.
