# 1

Let all on earth their voices raise,

To sing the great Jehovah’s praise,

And bless His holy name:

His glory let the people know,

His wonders to the nations show,

His saving grace proclaim.



# 2

He framed the globe; He built the sky;

He made the shining worlds on high,

And reigns in glory there:

His beams are majesty and light;

His beauties, how divinely bright!

His dwelling place, how fair!



# 3

Come, the great day, the glorious hour,

When earth shall feel His saving power,

All nations fear His name;

Then shall the race of men confess

The beauty of His holiness,

His saving grace proclaim.
