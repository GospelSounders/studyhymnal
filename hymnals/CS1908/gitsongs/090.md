I stood outside the gate,

A poor, wayfaring child:

Within my heart there beat

A tempest loud and wild;

A fear oppressed my soul,

That I might be too late;

And oh, I trembled sore,

And pray'd outside the gate,

And pray'd outside the gate.

"Now give me rest from sin!"

"I will," a voice replied;

And Mercy let me in;

She bound my bleeding wounds,

And soothed my heart, opprest;

She washed away my guilt

And gave me peace and rest,

And gave me peace and rest.

In Mercy's guise I knew

Who often sought my heart,

And wept when I refused;

Oh!  what a blest return

For all my years of sin!

And Jesus let me in,

And Jesus let me in,
