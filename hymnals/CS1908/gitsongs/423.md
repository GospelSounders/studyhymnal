# 1

God of the universe, to thee

These sacred walls we rear;

And now, with songs and bended knee,

Invoke thy presence here.



# 2

When sad with care, by sin oppressed,

Here may the burdened soul

Beneath thy shelt'ring wing find rest;

Here make the wounded whole.



# 3

And when the last long Sabbath morn

Upon the just shall rise,

May all who own thee here, be borne

To mansions in the skies.
