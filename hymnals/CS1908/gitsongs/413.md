413 â€“ Faith Views Him


1
Buried beneath the yielding wave
The great Redeemer lies;
Faith views him in the watery grave,
And thence beholds him rise.

2
Thus do these willing souls today
Their ardent zeal express,
And in the Lord's appointed way
Fulfill all righteousness.

3
With joy we in his footsteps tread,
And would his cause maintain;
Like him be numbered with the dead,
And with him rise and reign.
