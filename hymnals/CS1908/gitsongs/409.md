# 1

I will follow thee, my Saviour,

Wheresoe'er my lot may be;

Where thou goest I will follow;

Yes, my Lord, I'll follow thee.



Chorus:

I will follow thee, my Saviour,

Thou didst shed thy blood for me;

And tho' all men should forsake thee,

By thy grace I'll follow thee.



# 2

Tho' the road be rough and thorny,

Trackless as the foaming sea,

Thou hast trod this way before me,

And I'll gladly follow thee.

[Chorus]



# 3

Tho' I meet with tribulations,

Surely tempted tho' I be;

I remember thou wast tempted

And rejoice to follow thee.  [Chorus]



# 4

Though thou lead'st me thro' affliction,

Poor, forsaken, though I be;

Thou wast destitute, afflicted,

And I only follow thee.  [Chorus]



# 5

Though to Jordan's rolling billows,

Cold and deep, thou leadest me,

Thou hast crossed the waves before me,

And I still will follow thee.  [Chorus]
