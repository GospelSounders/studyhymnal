May God be with you Till we meet again,

May God be with you, Keep you safe till then;

And may His blessings Be within your heart,

May God be with you While we’re apart,

May God be with you.



# 2

May God be with you, Watch you from above,

May God protect you in His tender love;

And with the dawning Of each bright, new day,

May God be with you, To guide your way,

May God be with you.
