# 1

Saviour!  I follow on,

Guided by thee,

Seeing not yet the hand

That leadeth me;

Hushed be my heart, and still,

Fear I no further ill;

Only to meet thy will

My will shall be.



# 2

Riven the Rock for me,

Thirst to relieve,

Manna from heaven falls

Fresh ev'ry eve;

Never a want severe

Causeth mine eye a tear,

But thou dost whisper near,

"Only believe!"



# 3

Often to Marah's brink

Have I been bro't;

Shrinking the cup to drink,

Help I have sought;

And with the prayer's ascent,

Jesus the branch hath rent

Quickly relief hath sent,

Sweet'ning the draught.



# 4

Saviour!  I long to walk

Closer with thee;

Led by thy guiding hand,

Ever to be

Constantly near thy side,

Quickened and purified,

Living for him who died

Freely for me.
