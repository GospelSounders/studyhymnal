# 1

Watch, ye saints, with eyelids waking;

Lo! The powers of heaven are shaking;

Keep your lamps all trimmed an burning,

Ready for your Lord’s returning.



# Refrain

Lo! He comes, lo! Jesus comes;

Lo! He come, He comes all glorious!

Jesus comes to reign victorious,

Lo! He comes, yes, Jesus comes.



# 2

Lo! the promise of your Savior,

Pardoned sin and purchased favor,

Blood-washed robes and crowns of glory;

Haste to tell redemption’s story.



# 3

Kingdoms at their base are crumbling,

Hark! His chariot wheels are rumbling;

Tell, O tell of grace abounding,

While the seventh trump is sounding.



# 4

Nations wane, though proud and stately;

Christ His kingdom hasteneth greatly;

Earth her latest pangs is summing;

Shout, ye saints, your Lord is coming.



# 5

Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading;

Now for you He’s interceding;

Haste, ere grace and time diminished

Shall proclaim the mystery finished.
