# 1

Almost persuaded now to believe.

Almost persuaded Christ to receive.

Seems now some soul to say, 

"Go, Spirit, go Thy way,

Some more convenient day

On Thee I'll call."



# 2

Almost persuaded, come, come, today:

Almost persuaded; turn not away.

Jesus invites you here,

Angels are ling'ring near,

Pray'rs rise from hearts so dear:

O wand'rer come!



# 3

Almost persuaded; harvest is past!

Almost persuaded; doom comes at last!

"Almost" can not avail,

"Almost" is but to fail!

Sad, and that bitter wail

"Almost, but lost!"
