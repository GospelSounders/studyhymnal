# 1

O God, whose will is life and good

For all of mortal breath:

Unite in bonds of servanthood

All those who strive with death.



# 2

Make strong their hands and hearts and wills

To drive disease afar,

To strive against the body’s ills

And wage Your healing war.



# 3

By healing of the sick and blind,

Christ’s mercy they proclaim,

Make known the great physician’s mind,

Affirm the Savior’s name.



# 4

Before them set Your gracious will,

That they, with heart and soul,

To You may consecrate their skill

And make the sufferer whole.
