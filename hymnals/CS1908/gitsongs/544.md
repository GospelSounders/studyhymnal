# 1

Throw out the Life-Line across the dark wave,

There is a brother whom some one shall save;

Somebody's brother!  oh, who then, will dare

To throw out the Life-Line his peril to share?



Chorus:

Throw out the Life-Line!  Throw out the Life-Line!

Some one is drifting away; 

Throw out the Life-Line!  Throw out the Life-Line!

Some one is sinking today.



# 2

Throw out the Life-Line, With hand quick and strong,

Why do you tarry, why linger so long?

See!  he is sinking; oh, hasten today

And out with the Life-Boat!  away, then, away!  [Chorus]



# 3

Throw out the Life-Line to danger-fraught men,

Sinking in anguish where you've never been:

Winds of temptation and billows of woe

Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow.  [Chorus]



# 4

Soon will the season of rescue be o'er,

Soon will they drift to eternity's shore,

Haste, then, my brother, no time for delay,

But throw out the Life-Line and save them today.  [Chorus]
