# 1

One thing I of the Lord desire,

For all my paths have miry been,

Be it by water or by fire,

O make me clean, O make me clean.



Refrain:

So wash me thou, without, within,

Or purge with fire, If that must be,

No matter how, if only sin die out in me,

die out in me.



# 2

If clearer vision thou impart,

Grateful and glad my soul shall be;

But yet to have a purer heart,

Is more to me, Is more to me.  [Refrain]



# 3

Yea, only as this heart is clean

May larger vision yet be mine,

For mirrored in Thy life are seen

The things divine, The things divine.  [Refrain]



# 4

I watch to shun the miry way,

And stanch the springs of guilty thought,

But watch and struggle as I may,

Pure I am not, Pure I am not.  [Refrain]
