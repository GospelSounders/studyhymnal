054 â€“ Keep Tenting Toward the Highlands


1
Are you tenting on the lowlands
Of the fated, flow'ry plain?
Are you nearing life's high mountains,
As the night comes on again?  

Chorus:
Keep tenting toward the highlands,
Each evening nearer home,
Keep tenting toward the highlands,
Keep tenting nearer home.

2
Does fair Sodom in her glory
Beckon you with ease or gain?
Heed her awful judgment story;
Linger not, her joys are vain.  [Chorus]

3
To the mountains of salvation!
Hear the angel, Mercy, call;
Do not tarry!  look not backward!
Hasten on ere vengeance fall.  [Chorus]
