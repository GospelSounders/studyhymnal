# 1

Lord, while for all mankind we pray

Of every clime and coast,

O hear us for our native land,

The land we love the most!



# 2

O guard our shores from every foe,

With peace our borders bless;

With prosperous times our cities crown,

Our fields with plenteousness!



# 3

Unite us in the sacred love

Of knowledge, truth, and Thee;

And let our hills and valleys shout

The songs of liberty.



# 4

Lord of the nations, thus to Thee

Our country we commend;

Be Thou her Refuge and her trust,

Her everlasting friend.
