1
God has said, "Forever blessed
Those who seek me in their youth;
Thy shall find the path of wisdom,
And the narrow way of truth."
Guide us, Saviour,
Guide us, Saviour,
In the narrow way of truth.

2
Be our strength, for we are weakness;
Be our wisdom and our guide;
May we walk in love and meekness,
Nearer to our Saviour's side:
Naught can harm us;
Naught can harm us;
While we thus in thee abide.
