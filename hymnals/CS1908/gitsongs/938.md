1.

The glories of that heav'nly land

I've ofttimes felt before;

But what I feel is just a taste,

And makes me long for more,

And makes me long for more.



2.

Had I the pinious of a dove,

I'd fly and be at rest;

Then would I go to Christ, my love,

And dwell among the blest,

And dwell among the blest.



3.

But Patience bids us wait awhile!

The crown's for them that fight;

The prize for those that win the race

By faith, and not by sight,

By faith, and not by sight.
