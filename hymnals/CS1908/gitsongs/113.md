# 1

God calling yet!  shall I not hear?

Earth's pleasures shall I still hold dear?

Shall life's swift passing years all fly,

And still my soul in slumber lie?



# 2

God calling yet!  shall I not rise?

Can I his loving voice despise,

And basely his kind care repay?

He calls me still; can I delay?



# 3

God calling yet!  and shall he knock,

And I my heart the closer lock?

He still is waiting to receive,

And shall I dare his Spirit grieve?



# 4

God calling yet!  and shall I give

No heed, but still in bondage live?

I wait, but he does not forsake:

He calls me still; my heart, awake!



# 5

God calling yet!  I cannot stay;

My heart I yield without delay;

Vain world, farewell!  from thee I part;

The voice of God hath reached my heart.
