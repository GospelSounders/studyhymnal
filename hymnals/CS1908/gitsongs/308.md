# 1

Hover o'er me, Holy Spirit,

Bathe my trembling heart and brow;

Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,

Come, O come and fill me now.

Fill me now, fill me now,

Jesus, come and fill me now.

Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,

Come, O come and fill me now.



# 2

Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit,

Tho' I cannot tell thee how;

But I need thee, greatly need thee;

Come, O come and fill me now.

Fill me now, fill me now,

Jesus, come and fill me now.

Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,

Come, O come and fill me now.



# 3

I am weakness, full of weakness;

At thy sacred feet I bow;

Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,

Fill with love, and fill me now.

Fill me now, fill me now,

Jesus, come and fill me now.

Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,

Come, O come and fill me now.



# 4

Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me;

Bathe, O, bathe my heart and brow;

Thou art conforting and saving,

Thou art sweetly filling now.

Fill me now, fill me now,

Jesus, come and fill me now.

Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,

Come, O come and fill me now.
