1.

There is a blessed hope,

More precious and more bright

Than all the joyless mockery

The world esteems delight.



2.

There is a lovely star

That lights the darkest gloom,

And sheds a peaceful radiance o'er

The prospects of the tomb.



3.

There is a cheering voice

That lifts the soul above,

Dispels the painful, anxious doubt,

And whispers, "God is love."



4.

That voice from Calv'ry's height

Proclaims the soul forgiv'n;

That star is revelation's light,

That hope, the hope of heav'n.
