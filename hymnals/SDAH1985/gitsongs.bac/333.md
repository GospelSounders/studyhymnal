# 1

On Jordan’s banks the Baptist’s cry

Announces that the Lord is nigh;

Awake and hearken, for he brings

Glad tidings of the King of kings!



# 2

Then cleansed be every life from sin;

Make straight the way for God within,

And let us all our hearts prepare

For Christ to come and enter there.



# 3

We hail You as our Savior, Lord,

Our refuge and our great reward;

Without Your grace we waste away

Like flow’rs that wither and decay.



# 4

Stretch forth Your hand, our health restore,

And make us rise to fall no more;

Oh, let Your face upon us shine

And fill the world with love divine.
