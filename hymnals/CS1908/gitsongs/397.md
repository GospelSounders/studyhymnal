# 1

Rejoice and be glad, the Redeemer has come;

Go look on his cradle, his cross, and his tomb.



Chorus:

Sound His praises, tell the story

Of Him who was slain;

Sound his praises, tell with gladness,

He liveth again.

Final:  He cometh again.



# 2

Rejoice and be glad, for the Lamb that was slain,

O'er death is triumphant, and liveth again.  [Chorus]



# 3

Rejoice and be glad, for our King is on high,

He pleadeth for us on his throne in the sky.  [Chorus]



# 4

Rejoice and be glad, for he cometh again,

He cometh in glory, the Lamb that was slain.  [Chorus]
