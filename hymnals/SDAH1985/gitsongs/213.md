# 1

Lift up the trumpet, and loud let it ring:

Jesus is coming again!

Cheer up, ye pilgrims, be joyful and sing:

Jesus is coming again!



# Refrain

Coming again, coming again,

Jesus is coming again!



# 2

Echo it, hilltops; proclaim it, ye plains:

Jesus is coming again!

Coming in glory, the Lamb that was slain;

Jesus is coming again!



# 3

Heavings of earth, tell the vast, wondering throng:

Jesus is coming again!

Tempests and whirlwinds, the anthem prolong;

Jesus is coming again!



# 4

Nations are angry–by this we do know

Jesus is coming again!

Knowledge increases; men run to and fro;

Jesus is coming again!
