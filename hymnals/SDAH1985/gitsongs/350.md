# 1

Blest be the tie that binds

our hearts in Christian love;

the fellowship of kindred minds

is like to that above.



# 2

Before our Father’s throne

we pour our ardent prayers;

our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,

our comforts and our cares.



# 3

We share each other’s woes,

our mutual burdens bear;

and often for each other flows

the sympathizing tear.



# 4

When we asunder part,

it gives us inward pain;

but we shall still be joined in heart,

and hope to meet again.
