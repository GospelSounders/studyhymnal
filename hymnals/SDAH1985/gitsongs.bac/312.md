# 1

Jesus, keep me near the cross;

there a precious fountain,

free to all, a healing stream,

flows from Calvary’s mountain.



# Refrain

In the cross, in the cross,

be my glory ever,

till my raptured soul shall find

rest beyond the river.



# 2

Near the cross, a trembling soul,

love and mercy found me;

there the bright and morning star

sheds its beams around me.



# 3

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,

bring its scenes before me;

help me walk from day to day

with its shadow o’er me.



# 4

Near the cross I’ll watch and wait,

hoping, trusting ever,

till I reach the golden strand
