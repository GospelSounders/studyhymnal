# 1

Come unto me when shadows darkly gather,

When the sad heart is weary and distressed;

Seeking for comfort from your heav'nly Father,

Come unto me, and I will give you rest.



# 2

Large are the mansions in my Father's dwelling,

Glad are those homes that sorrows never dim;

Sweet are the harps in holy music swelling,

Soft are the tones that raise the heav'nly hymn.



# 3

There, like an Eden blossoming in gladness,

Bloom the fair flow'rs by earth so rudely pressed;

Come unto him all ye who droop in sadness,

"Come unto me, and I will give you rest."
