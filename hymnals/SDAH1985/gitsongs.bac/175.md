# 1

Now the green blade rises from the buried grain,

What that in dark earth many days has lain;

Love lives again, that with the dead has been;

Love is come again like wheat arising green.



# 2

In the grave they laid Him, love by hatred slain,

Thinking that He would never wake again,

Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen;

Love is come again like wheat arising green.



# 3

Forth He came in triumph, like the risen grain,

He that for three days in the grave had lain;

Raised from the dead, my living Lord is seen;

Love is come again like wheat arising green.



# 4

When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain,

Your touch can call us back to life again,

Field of our hearts that dead and bare have been;

Love is come again like wheat arising green.
