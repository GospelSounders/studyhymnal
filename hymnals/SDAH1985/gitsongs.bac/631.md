# 1

When on life a darkness falls,

When the mist flows chilling,

Paths and sign posts lost in doubt,

Loveless, unfulfilling,

Reach us, Jesus, from Your cross,

Though we feel forsaken;

Keep us through the aching night

Till new dawns awaken.



# 2

When the dreams and vows of youth

Painfully accuse us,

Stab our conscience, steal our worth,

Christ will not refuse us:

Peace the world cannot provide,

Daily resurrection,

Strong companion at our side

For each new direction.



# 3

Come and meet Him, Friend and Lord,

Thro’ the gospel story:

Open door to life and peace,

Window into glory.

All who seek Him, soon are found,

Made His close relation:

Christ our pathway, Christ our home,

Christ our sure foundation.
