# 1

Gracious Father, guard thy children

From the foe's destructive pow'r;

Save O save them, Lord, from falling

In this dark and trying hour.

Thou wilt surely prove thy people,

All our graces must be tried; 

But thy word illumes our pathway,

And in God we still confide.



# 2

 We are in the time of waiting;

Soon we shall behold our Lord,

Wafted far away from sorrow,

To receive our rich reward.

Keep us, Lord, till thine appearing,

Pure, unspotted from the world;

Let thy Holy Spirit cheer us

Till thy banner is unfurled.
