# 1

Let thy Spirit, blessed Saviour,

Come and bid our doubtings cease;

Come, O come with love and favor,

Fill us all with joy and peace.



# 2

Fearful dangers are around us,

Satan watches to destroy;

Lord, our foes would fain confound us;

O for us thy might employ!



# 3

On thy word our souls are resting;

Taught by thee, thy name we love;

Sweetest of all names is Jesus;

How it doth our spirits move!
