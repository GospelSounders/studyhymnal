# 1

Soldiers of the cross, arise!

Lo!  your Leader from the skies

Waves before you glory's prize,

Prize of victory.

Seize your armor, gird it on:

Soon the battle will be won;

See!  the strife is almost done;

Struggle manfully.



# 2

Now the fight of faith begin,

Be no more the slaves of sin,

Strive the victor's palm to win,

Trusting in the Lord:

Gird ye on the armor bright,

Warriors of the King of Light,

Never yield, nor lose by flight

Your divine reward.



# 3

Jesus conquered when he fell,

Met and vanquished sin and hell;

Now he bids his foll'wers tell

Triumphs of his cross.

Tho' the evil hosts appear,

Who can doubt, or who can fear?

God our strength and shield, is near;

Can we suffer loss?
