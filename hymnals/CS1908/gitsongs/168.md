# 1

Jesus calls us, o'er the tumult

Of our life's wild, restless sea;

Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,

Saying, Christian, follow me!



# 2

Jesus calls us from the worship

Of the vain world's golden store;

From each idol that would keep us,

Saying, Christian, love me more!



# 3

In our joys and in our sorrows,

Days of toil and hours of ease,

Still He calls, in cares and pleasures,

Christian, love me more than these!



# 4

Jesus calls us!  by Thy mercies,

Saviour, may we hear Thy call,

Give our hearts to Thy obedience,

Serve and love Thee best of all!
