# 1

Like as a father, pities his child,

So the Lord pities the sinner defiled;

Waiteth in kindness,

Pities our blindness,

Longeth to welcome, tho' often reviled.



# 2

Like as a father when we believe,

Merciful Saviour, He waits to receive;

Listens to hear us,

Blesses to cheer us,

Pities whenever His Spirit we grieve.



# 3

Like as a father, ever the same,

He that created, and knoweth our frame;

Watcheth the straying,

Guardeth the praying,

Bids us to trust in His Almighty name.



# 4

Like as a father, constant is He,

God is our passion regardeth our plea;

In need He cometh, 

Precious His promise;

Father in heaven for ever to be.
