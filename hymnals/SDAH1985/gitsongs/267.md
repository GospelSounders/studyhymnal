# 1

Spirit divine, attend our prayers,

And make this house Thy home;

Descend with all Thy gracious powers,

O come, great Spirit, come!



# 2

Come as the light; to us reveal

Our emptiness and woe,

And lead us in those paths of life

Where-on the righteous go.



# 3

Come as the fire, and purge our hearts

Like sacrificial flame;

Let our whole soul an of – f’ring be

To our Redeemer’s name.



# 4

Come as the dove, and spread Thy wings,

The wings of peaceful love;

And let Thy church on earth become

Blest as the church above.



# 5

Spirit divine, attend our prayers,

Make a lost world Thy home;

Descend with all Thy gracious powers,

O come, great Spirit, come!
