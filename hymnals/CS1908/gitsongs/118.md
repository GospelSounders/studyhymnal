# 1

O Jesus!  thou art standing

Outside the fast-closed door,

In lowly patience waiting

To pass the threshold o'er:

We bear the name of Christians,

Thy name and sign we bear:

O, shame, thrice shame upon us!

To keep thee standing there.



# 2

O Jesus!  thou art knocking;

And lo!  that hand is scarred,

And thorns thy brow encircle,

And tears thy face have marred;

O, love that passeth knowledge,

So patiently to wait!

O, sin that hath no equal,

So fast to bar the gate!



# 3

O Jesus!  thou art pleading

In accents meek and low,

"I died for you, my children,

And will ye treat me so?"

O Lord, with shame and sorrow

We open now the door:

Dear Saviour, quickly enter,

And leave us nevermore!
