# 1

There's a Stranger at the door, 

Let him in;

He has been there oft before, 

Let him in;

Let him in, ere he is gone,

Let him in, the Holy One,

Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, 

Let him in.



# 2

Open now to him your heart,

Let him in;

If you wait he will depart,

Let him in;

Let him in, he is your friend,

And your soul he will defend;

He will keep you to the end, 

Let him in.



# 3

Hear you now his pleading voice?

Let him in;

Now, O now make him your choice,

Let him in.

He is standing at the door,

Joy to you he will restore,

And his name you will adore,

Let him in.



# 4

Now admit the heav'nly guest,

Let him in:

He will make for you a feast,

Let him in;

He will speak your sins forgiv'n,

And when earth ties all are riv'n,

He will take your home to heav'n,

Let him in.
