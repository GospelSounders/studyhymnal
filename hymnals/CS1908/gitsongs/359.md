# 1

I heard the voice of Jesus say,

"Come unto me and rest;

Lay down; thou weary one lay down

Thy head upon my breast."

I came to Jesus as I was

Weary, and worn, and sad;

I found in him a resting place,

And he has made me glad.



# 2

I heard the voice of Jesus say, 

"Behold, I freely give

The living water; thirsty one,

Stoop down and drink and live."

I came to Jesus, and I drank

Of that life-giving stream;

My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,

And now I live in him.



# 3

I heard the voice of Jesus say,

"I am this dark world's light.

Look unto me; thy morn shall rise,

And all thy days be bright."

I look'd to Jesus, and I found

In him my star, my sun;

And in that light of life I'll walk,

Till all my journey's done.
