# 1

The morning light is breaking,

The darkness disappears,

The sons of earth are waking

To penitential tears;

Each breeze that sweeps the ocean

Brings tidings from afar,

Of nations in commotion,

Prepared for Zion's war.



# 2

Rich dew of grace come o'er us,

In many a gentle show'r,

And harvest fields before us

Are op'ning ev'ry hour;

Each cry to heaven going,

Abundant answer brings,

And heav'nly gales are blowing,

With peace upon their wings.



# 3

Blest river of salvation,

Pursue thy onward way;

Flow thou to ev'ry nation, 

Nor in thy richness stay.

Stay not till all the lowly

Triumphant reach their home;

Stay not till all the holy

Proclaim, "The Lord is come."
