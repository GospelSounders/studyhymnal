# 1

With songs and honors sounding loud,

Address the Lord on high;

Over the heavens He spreads His cloud,

And waters veil the sky.



# 2

He sends His showers of blessing down

To cheer the plains below;

He makes the grass the mountains crown,

And corning valleys grow.



# 3

His steady counsels change the face

Of the declining year;

He bids the sun cut short his race,

And wintry days appear.



# 4

He sends His word, and melts the snow;

The fields no longer mourn;

He calls the warmer gales to blow,

And bids the spring return.



# 5

The changing wind, the flying cloud,

Obey His mighty word:

With songs and honors sounding loud

Praise ye the sovereign Lord!
