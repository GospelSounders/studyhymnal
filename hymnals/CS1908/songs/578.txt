578 – Beautiful Flowers


1
We should be like gardens,
Bright and sweet with flow'rs,
Bless'd with heaven's sunshine,
Cheer'd by gentle show'rs;
Violets are the kind words,
Roses, deeds of love,
Fragrant pinks and pansies,
Tho'ts of God above.

Chorus:
Beautiful flow'rs, beautiful flow'rs,
Bright with morning dew;
Beautiful flow'rs, beautiful flow'rs,
We would be like you.

2
Not a frown of anger,
Not a shade of care,
Not one look of sadness
Do the blossoms wear;
They are always trusting,
This is how they grow
Beautiful and fragrant,
In a world of woe.  [Chorus]

3
Selfish tho'ts and wishes,
Unkind words and deeds,
Are like cruel brambles,
Thistles, thorns, and weeds;
Kind tho'ts are the sweetest,
Loving words the best,
Yielding hope and comfort,
Joy, and peace, and rest.  [Chorus]

4
Jesus has a garden,
Fill'd with children sweet;
We would be among them,
Bowing at his feet,
Drinking in life's waters,
Growing by his grace,
Like the flowers, looking
Up into his face.  [Chorus]
