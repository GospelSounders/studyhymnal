# 1

Rise up, O men of God!

His kingdom tarries long.

Bring in the day of brotherhood

and end the night of wrong.



# 2

Let women all rise up!

Have done with lesser things.

Give heart and mind and soul and strength

to serve the King of kings.



# 3

Rise up, courageous youth!

The church for you doth wait,

her strength unequal to her task;

rise up, and make her great!



# 4

Lift high the cross of Christ!

Tread where his feet have trod.

Disciples of the Son of Man,

rise up, O church of God!
