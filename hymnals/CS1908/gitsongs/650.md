# 1

I love thee, I love thee, I love thee, my Lord;

I love thee my Saviour, I love thee, my God.

I love thee, I love thee, and that thou dost know;

But how much I love then my actions will show.



# 2

I'm happy, I'm happy, O, wondrous account!

My joys are immortal, I stand on the mount!

I gaze on my treasure and long to be there,

With Jesus and angels, and kindred so dear.



# 3

O Jesus, my Saviour, with thee I am blest,

My life and salvation, my joy and my rest.

Thy love be my story, thy name be my song;

Thy grace shall inspire both my heart and my tongue.



# 4

O, who's like my Saviour?  he's Salem's bright King;

He smiles, and he loves me, and helps me to sing.

I'll praise him, I'll praise him with notes loud and clear,

While rivers of pleasure my spirit do cheer.
