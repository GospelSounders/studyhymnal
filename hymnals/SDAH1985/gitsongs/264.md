# 1

O for that flame of living fire

Which shone so bright in saints of old;

Which bade their souls to heaven aspire,

Calm in distress, in danger bold!



# 2

Where is that spirit, Lord, which dwelt

In Abram’s breast, and sealed Him Thine?

Which made Paul’s heart with sorrow melt,

And glow with energy divine?



# 3

That spirit which from age to age

Proclaimed Thy love, and taught Thy ways?

Brightened Isaiah’s vivid page,

And breathed in David’s hallowed lays?



# 4

Is not Thy grace as mighty now

As when Elijah felt its power?

When glory beamed from Moses’ brow,

Or Job endured the trying hour?



# 5

Remember, Lord, the ancient days;

Renew Thy work, Thy grace restore;

And while to Thee our hearts we raise,

On us Thy Holy Spirit pour.
