# 1

Every star shall sing a carol;

Every creatures, high or low,

Come and praise the King of heaven

By whatever name you know.

God above, Man below,

Holy is the name I know.



# 2

When the King of all creation

Had a cradle on the earth,

Holy was the human body,

Holy was the human birth.

God above, Man below,

Holy is the name I know.



# 3

Every star and every planet,

Every creature, high or low,

Come and praise the King of heaven

By whatever name you know.

God above, Man below,

Holy is the name I know.
