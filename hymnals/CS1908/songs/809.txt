809 â€“ What Is the Chaff?


1.
What is the chaff, the word of man,
When set against the wheat?
Can it a dying soul sustain
Like that immortal meat?

2.
Thy word, O God, with heav'nly bread
Thy children doth supply;
And those who by thy word are fed,
Their souls shall never die.

3.
'Tis like a field where hidden lies
The pearl of price unknown,
And he indeed is truly wise
Who makes this pearl his own.
