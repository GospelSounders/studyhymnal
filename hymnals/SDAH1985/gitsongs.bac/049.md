# 1

Savior, breathe an evening blessing,

Ere repose our spirits seal;

Sin and want we come confessing;

Thou canst save, and Thou canst heal.



# 2

Though the night be dark and dreary,

Darkness cannot hide from Thee;

Thou art He who, never weary,

Watchest where Thy people be.



# 3

Though destruction walk around us.

Though the arrow past us fly,

Angel guards from Thee Surround us,

We are safe if Thou art nigh.



# 4

Should swift death this night o’re-take us,

And our couch become our tomb,

May the morn of glory wake us,

Clad in light and deathless bloom.
