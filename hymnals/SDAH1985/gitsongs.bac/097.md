# 1

Lord of the boundless curves of space

And time’s deep mystery,

To Your creative might we trace

All nature’s energy.



# 2

Your mind conceived the galaxy,

Each atom’s secret planned,

And every age of history

Your purpose, Lord, has spanned.



# 3

Yours is the image stamped on man,

Though marred by man’s own sin;

And Yours the liberating plan

Again his soul to win.



# 4

Give us to know Your truth; but more,

The strength to do Your will;

Until the love our souls adore

Shall all our being fill.
