1.

O teach me, Lord, that I may teach

The precious things Thou dost impart;

And wing my words, that they may reach

The hidden depths of many a heart.



2.

O fill me with Thy fulness, Lord,

Until my very heart o'erflow

In kindly tho't and glowing word,

Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.



3.

O use me, Lord, use even me,

Just as Thou wilt, and when, and where;

Until Thy blessed face I see,

Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.
