# 1

Lonely!  no, not lonely

While Jesus standeth by;

His presence always cheers me;

I know that he is nigh.

Friendless?  no, not friendless,

For Jesus is my Friend;

I change, but he remaineth,

The same unto the end.



Chorus:

No, never alone, no, never alone;

He has promised never to leave me,

Never to leave me alone.

No, never alone, no, never alone;

He has promised never to leave me,

Never to leave me alone.



# 2

Weary?  no, not weary

While leaning on his breast;

My soul hath full enjoyment,

In His eternal rest.

Helpless?  yes, so helpless;

But I am leaning hard

On the mighty arm of Jesus,

And he is keeping guard.  [Chorus]



# 3

Waiting?  yes, I'm waiting;

He bids me watch and wait;

I only wonder often,

What makes my Lord so late.

Joyful?  yes, so joyful,

With joy too deep for words;

A precious, sure foundation,

The joy that is my Lord's.  [Chorus]
