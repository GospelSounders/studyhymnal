# 1

Come, dearest Lord, and feed thy sheep,

On this sweet day of rest;

O bless this flock, and make this fold

Enjoy a heav'nly rest,

Enjoy a heav'nly rest.



# 2

Welcome and precious to my soul

Are these sweet days of love,

But what a Sabbath shall I keep

When I shall rest above,

When I shall rest above!



# 3

O, if my soul, when Christ appears,

In this sweet frame be found,

I'll clasp my Saviour in my arms,

And leave this earthly ground,

And leave this earthly ground!
