# 1

Praise we the Lord, who made all beauty

For all our senses to enjoy;

Owe we our humble thanks and duty

That simple pleasures never cloy;

Praise we the Lord, who made all beauty

For all our senses to enjoy.



# 2

Praise Him who loves to see young lovers,

Fresh hearts that swell with youthful pride;

Thank Him who sends the sun above us,

As bridegroom fit to meet his bride;

Praise Him who loves to see young lovers,

Fresh hearts that swell with youthful pride.



# 3

Praise Him who by a simple flower

Lifts up our hearts to things above;

Thank Him who gives to each one power

To find a friend to know and love;

Praise Him who by a simple flower

Lifts up our hearts to things above.
