# 1

Jesus shall reign where’er the sun

Does his successive journeys run;

His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,

Till moons shall wax and wane no more.



# 2

People and realms of ev’ry tongue

Dwell on His love with sweetest song,

And infant voices shall proclaim

Their early blessings on His name.



# 3

Blessings abound wherever He reigns;

The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;

The weary find eternal rest,

And all who suffer want are blessed.



# 4

Let every creature rise and bring

Honors peculiar to our King;

Angels descend with songs again,

And earth repeat the loud amen!
