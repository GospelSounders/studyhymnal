# 1

And can it be that I should gain

an interest in the Savior’s blood!

Died he for me? who caused his pain!

For me? who him to death pursued?

Amazing love! How can it be

that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?



# Refrain

Amazing love! How can it be

that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?



# 2

He left his Father’s throne above

so free, so infinite his grace!;

emptied himself of all but love,

and bled for Adam’s helpless race.

‘Tis mercy all, immense and free,

for O my God, it found out me!



# 3

Long my imprisoned sprit lay,

fast bound in sin and nature’s night;

thine eye diffused a quickening ray;

I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;

my chains fell off, my heart was free,

I rose, went forth, and followed thee.



# 4

No condemnation now I dread;

Jesus, and all in him, is mine;

alive in him, my living Head,

and clothed in righteousnes divine,

bold I approach th’ eternal throne,

and claim the crown, through Christ my own.
