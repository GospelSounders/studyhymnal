1.

Rest for the toiling hand,

Rest for the anxious brow,

Rest for the weary, way-worn feet,

Rest from all labor now.



2.

Soon shall the trump of God

Give out the welcome sound

That shakes thy silent chamber walls,

And breaks the turf-sealed ground.



3.

'Twas sown in weakness here,

'Twill then be raised in pow'r;

That which was sown as earthly seed,

Shall rise a heav'nly flow'r!
