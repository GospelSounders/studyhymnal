# 1

By Christ redeemed, In Christ restored,

We keep the memory adored,

And show the death of our dear Lord,

Until He come.



# 2

His broken body in our stead is here,

In his memorial bread;

And so our feeble love is fed,

Until He come.



# 3

His fearful drops of agony,

His lifeblood shed for us we see;

The wine shall tell the mystery,

Until He come.



# 4

And thus that dark betrayal night,

With the last advent we unite

The shame, the glory, by this rite,

Until He come.
