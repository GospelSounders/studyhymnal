# 1

Sav'd to the uttermost:  I am the Lord's

Jesus, my Saviour, salvation affords;

Gives me his Spirit, a witness within,

Whisp'ring of pardon, and saving from sin.



Refrain:

Sav'd, sav'd, sav'd to the uttermost,

Sav'd, sav'd by power divine;

Sav'd, sav'd, sav'd to the uttermost,

Jesus, the Saviour, is mine!



# 2

Sav'd to the uttermost:  Jesus is near;

Keeping me safely, he casteth out fear;

Trusting his promises, now I am blest;

Leaning upon him, how sweet is my rest.  [Refrain]



# 3

Sav'd to the uttermost:  this I can say,

"Once all was darkness, but now it is day;

Beautiful visions of glory I see,

Jesus in brightness reveal'd unto me.  [Refrain]



# 4

Sav'd to the uttermost:  cheerfully sing

Loud halleluias to Jesus, my King!

Ransomed and pardoned, redeemed by his blood,

Cleans'd from unrighteousness:  glory to God!  [Refrain]
