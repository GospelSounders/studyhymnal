# 1

When morning lights the eastern skies,

Thy mercy, Lord, disclose;

And let Thy loving kindness rise;

On Thee my hopes repose.



Refrain:

On Thee my hopes repose,

On Thee my hopes repose,

And let Thy loving kindness rise;

On Thee my hopes repose.



# 2

Teach me the way where I should go;

I lift my soul to Thee;

Redeem me from the raging foe;

To Thee, O Lord, I flee.  [Refrain]



# 3

Because Thou art my God, I pray,

Teach me to do Thy will;

O lead me in the perfect way,

By Thy good Spirit still.  [Refrain]



# 4

Revive me, Lord, for Thy great name,

And for Thy judgment's sake;

From all my woes, O lord, reclaim,

My soul from trouble take.  [Refrain]
