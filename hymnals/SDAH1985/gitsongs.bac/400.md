# 1

I come with joy to meet my Lord,

Forgiven, loved and free,

In awe and wonder to recall

His life laid down for me,

His life laid down for me.



# 2

I come with Christians far and near

To find, as all are fed,

Our true community of love

In Christ’s communion bread,

In Christ’s communion bread.



# 3

As Christ breaks bread for us to share

Each proud division ends.

That love that made us makes us one,

And strangers now are friends,

And strangers now are friends.



# 4

And thus with joy we meet our Lord.

His presence always near,

Is in such friendship better known:

We see and praise Him here,

We see and praise Him here.



# 5

Together met, together bound,

We’ll go our diff’rent ways,

And as His people in the world,

We’ll live and speak His praise,

We’ll live and speak His praise.
