# 1

Abide with me, ’tis eventide!

The day is past and gone;

The shadows of the evening fall;

The night is coming on!

Within my heart a welcome guest,

Within my home abide;



# Refrain

O Savior, stay this night with me;

Behold, ’tis eventide!

O Savior, stay this night with me;

Behold, ’tis eventide.



# 2

Abide with me, ’tis eventide!

Thy walk today with me

Has made my heart within me burn,

As I communed with Thee.

Thy earnest words have filled my soul

And kept me near Thy side;



# 3

Abide with me, ’tis eventide!

And lone will be the night,

If I cannot commune with Thee,

Nor find in Thee my light.

The darkness of the world, I fear,

Would in my home abide;
