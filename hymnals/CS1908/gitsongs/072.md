# 1

Who'll be the next to follow Jesus?

Who'll be the next His cross to bear?

Some one is ready, some one is waiting;

Who'll be the next a crown to wear?



Refrain:

Who'll be the next?

Who'll be the next?

Who'll be the next to follow Jesus?

Who'll be the next to follow Jesus now?

Follow Jesus now?



# 2

Who'll be the next to follow Jesus

Follow His weary bleeding feet?

Who'll be the next to lay ev'ry burden

Down at the Father's mercy-seat?  [Chorus]



# 3

Who'll be the next to follow Jesus?

Who'll be the next to praise His name?

Who'll swell the chorus of free redemption

Sing, hallelujah!  praise the Lamb?  [Chorus]
