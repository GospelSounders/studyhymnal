# 1

Make me a captive, Lord, and then I shall be free;

Force me to render up my sword, and I shall conqueror be.

I sink in life’s alarms when by myself I stand;

Imprison me within Thine arms, and strong shall be my hand.



# 2

My heart is weak and poor until it amaster find;

It has no spring of action sure, it varies with the wind.

It cannot freely move till Thou has wrought its chain;

Enslave it with Thy matchless love, and deathless it shall reign.



# 3

My will is not my own till Thou hast made it Thine;

If it would reach a monarch’s throne, it must its crown resign;

It only stands unbent, amid the clashing strife,

When on Thy bosom it has leant, and found in Thee its life.
