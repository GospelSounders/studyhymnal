# 1

My heart was distress'd neath Jehovah's dread frown,

And low in the pit where my sins dragg'd me down;

I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay,

Who tenderly brought me out to golden day.



Chorus:

He brought me out of the miry clay,

He set my feet on the Rock to stay;

He puts a song in my soul to-day,

A song of praise, hallelujah!



# 2

He placed me upon the strong Rock by His side,

My steps were established and here I'll abide;

No danger of falling while here I remain,

But stand by His grace until the crown I gain.  [Chorus]



# 3

He gave me a song, 'twas a new song of praise.

By day and by night its sweet notes I will raise;

My heart's overflowing, I'm happy and free,

I'll praise my Redeemer, who has rescued me.  [Chorus]



# 4

I'll sing of His wonderful mercy to me,

I'll praise Him till all men His goodness shall see;

I'll sing of salvation at home and abroad,

Till many shall hear the truth and trust in God.  [Chorus]
