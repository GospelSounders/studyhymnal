# 1

To the name that brings salvation

Let the nations bow the head;

Let them kneel in adoration

When this name of names is said;

Let them pray for restoration

Of all things in Christ the head.



# 2

He through every generation

Rules in endless majesty;

May the kings of every nation

Now foreswear their enmity,

And with humble veneration

In the love of God agree.



# 3

Lord, we pray for upright rulers:

Guard them surely in their need

From the vanity of power

And the emptiness of greed;

Let them see the truth of lowness,

And on justice let them feed.
