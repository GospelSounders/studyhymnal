# 1

Buy up the opportunity,

O Christian, buy today;

For Heaven's ageless mansions buy,

Buy treasures while you may.



Chorus:

Buy up the opportunity,

The souls for when Christ died,

Buy up the opportunity,

Buy for the Crucified.



# 2

Buy up the opportunity,

It may not long remain;

The evil hosts are bidding, too,

Those precious souls to gain.  [Chorus]



# 3

Buy up the opportunity,

Pay any price to win;

With Heaven's legions watching you,

To falter will be sin.  [Chorus]



# 4

Buy up the opportunity,

At home; in lands afar;

Go quickly!  Find the jewels rare,

Each soul a glowing star.  [Chorus]
