# 1

Ye servants of the Lord,

Each in his office wait;

Observant of his heavn'ly word,

And watchful at his gate.

Observant of his heav'nly word,

And watchful at his gate.



# 2

Let all your lamps be bright,

And trim the golden flame;

Gird up your loins as in his sight;

His coming thus proclaim.

Gird up your loins as in his sight;

His coming thus proclaim.



# 3

Watch, 'tis your Lord's command,

And while we speak, he's near;

Mark the first signal of his hand,

And ready all appear.

Mark the first signal of his hand,

And ready all appear.



# 4

O, happy servant he,

In such a posture found!

He shall his Lord with rapture see,

And be with honor crown'd.

He shall his Lord with rapture see,

And be with honor crown'd.
