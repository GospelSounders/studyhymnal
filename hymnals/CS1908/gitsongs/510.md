# 1

Sound the battle cry, 

See!  the foe is nigh;

Raise the standard high  

For the Lord;

Gird your armor on, 

Stand firm, ev'ry one,

Rest your cause upon 

His holy word.



Chorus:

Rouse, then soldiers!  rally round the banner!

Ready, steady, pass the word along;

Onward, forward, shout a loud Hosanna!

Christ is Captain of the faithful throng.



# 2

Strong to meet the foe, 

Marching on we go,

While our cause we know  

Must prevail;

Shield and banner bright, 

Gleaming in the light,

Battling for the right, 

We ne'er can fail.  [Chorus]



# 3

O thou God of all, 

Hear us when we call, 

Help us, one and all, 

By thy grace;

When the battle's done,

And the vict'ry won,

May we wear the crown  

Before thy face.  [Chorus]
