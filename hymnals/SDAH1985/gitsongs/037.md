# 1

O sing my soul, your Maker’s praise

In grateful hymns ascending;

Whose steadfast love has crowned your days

With heav’nly gifts un ending.

I sought the Lord, He heard my cry;

His holy angels hover nigh

The tents of those who love Him.



# 2

The Lord is good to those who seek

His face in time of sorrow,

Providing comfort to the weak

And grace for each tomorrow.

Though grief may tarry for a night,

The morn shall break in joy and light

With blessings from His presence.



# 3

The Lord will turn His face in peace

When troubled souls draw near Him;

His loving kindness shall not cease

To those who trust and fear Him.

Our God will not forsake His own;

Eternal is His heav’nly throne;

His kingdom stands forever.
