365 – Perfect


1
Let all the heathen writers join
To form one perfect book;
Great God, if once compared with thine,
How mean their writings look!
How mean their writings look!

2
Not the most perfect rules they gave
Could show one sin forgiv'n,
Nor lead one step beyond the grave;
But thine conducts to heaven.
But thine conducts to heaven.

3
Yet men would fain be just with God
By works their hands have wrought;
But thy commands, exceeding broad,
Extend to every thought.
Extend to every thought.

4
Our faith, and love, and every grace,
Fall far below thy word;
But perfect truth and righteousness
Dwell only in the Lord.
Dwell only in the Lord.
