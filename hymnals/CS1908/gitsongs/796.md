1.

Gently think, and gently speak,

Art thou strong?  respect the weak;

Art thou weak?  from what thou art,

Gently touch another's heart.



2.

He who knew the thoughts of men,

Gentle was; O let us then

Careful be in thought and tone,

We, who scarce can read our own.



3.

Rain and dews, and sunshine fall,

With unbounded love, on all;

Shall my narrow heart refuse

Its poor sun, and rain, and dews?



4.

Then be gentle, O my soul,

Thoughts and words alike control;

If thou must in aught decide,

Err upon the gentle side.
