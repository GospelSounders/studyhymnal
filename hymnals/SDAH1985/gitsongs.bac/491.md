# 1

In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,

Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;

When Thou see’st me waver, with a look recall,

Nor, for fear or favor, suffer me to fall.



# 2

With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm;

Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm;

Bring to my remembrance sad Gethsemane,

Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary.



# 3

Should Thy mercy send me sorrow, toil, and woe,

Or should pain attend me on my path below,

Grant that I may never fail Thy hand to see;

Grant that I may ever cast my care on Thee.
