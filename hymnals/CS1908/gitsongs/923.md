1.

The time is near when Zion's sons

With holy joy shall sing the song

Foretold by seers--anointed ones;

We have a city great and strong,

We have a city great and strong.



2.

Open ye gates!  The glorious King

Approaches with a holy throng;

Open, ye gates!  Saints, angels, sing

On golden harps the victor's song!

On golden harps the victor's song.



3.

O righteous nation!  enter in,

That kept the law of truth below,

Enter the place, all free from sin,

Where life's pure waters gently flow.

Where life's pure waters gently flow.



4.

Within these walls shall they remain,

Who trusted, mighty Lord!  in thee:

Death, their last enemy, is slain;

They have a right to life's fair tree,

They have a right to life's fair tree.
