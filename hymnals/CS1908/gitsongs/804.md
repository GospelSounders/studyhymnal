1.

Sister, thou wast mild and lovely,

Gentle as the summer breeze;

Pleasant as the air of evening

When it floats among the trees.



2.

Dearest sister, thou hast left us!

Here thy loss we deeply feel;

But 'tis God that hath berelf us,

He can all our sorrows heal.



3.

Yet again we hope to meet thee,

When this mortal life is fled;

Then, in heav'n, with joy to greet thee,

Where no farewell tear is shed.
