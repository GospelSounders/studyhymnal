# 1

O Jesus Christ, to You may hymns be rising

In every city for Your love and care;

Inspire our worship, grant the glad surprising

That Your blest Spirit brings men everywhere.



# 2

Grant us new courage sacrificial humble

Strong in Your strength to venture and to dare,

To lift the fallen, guide the feet that stumble,

Seek out the lonely &amp;God’s mercy share



# 3

Show us Your Spirit, brooding oér each city,

As You did weep above Jerusalem,

Seeking to gather all in love and pity,

And healing those who touch Your garment’s hem.
