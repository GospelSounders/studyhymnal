# 1

Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,

and publish abroad his wonderful name;

the name all-victorious of Jesus extol,

his kingdom is glorious and rules over all.



# 2

God ruleth on high, almighty to save,

and still he is nigh, his presence we have;

the great congregation his triumph shall sing,

ascribing salvation to Jesus, our King.



# 3

“Salvation to God, who sits on the throne!”

Let all cry aloud and honor the Son;

the praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,

fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.



# 4

Then let us adore and give him his right,

all glory and power, all wisdom and might;

all honor and blessing with angels above,

and thanks never ceasing and infinite love.
