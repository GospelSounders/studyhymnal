# 1

Don’t you see my Jesus coming,

See Him come in yonder cloud?

With ten thousand angels round Him,

How they do my Jesus crowd!



# Refrain

I am bound for the kingdom,

Will you go to glory with me?

Hallelujah! O praise ye the Lord!



# 2

Don’t you see the saints ascending,

Hear them shouting thro’ the air.

Jesus smiling, trumpets sounding,

Now His glory they shall share.
