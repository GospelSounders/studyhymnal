# 1

I think when I read that sweet story of old,

When Jesus was here among men,

How he call'd little children as lambs to his fold,

I should like to have been with them then.

I wish that his hands had been placed on my head,

That his arm had been thrown around me,

And that I might have seen his kind look when he said,

"Let the little ones come unto me."



# 2

Yet still is the Saviour in pray'r I may go,

And ask for a share in his love,

And if I thus earnestly seek him below,

I shall see him and hear him above.

In that beautiful plan he has gone to prepare

For all who are wash'd and forgiv'n,

Oh, may we at last find a glad welcome there,

Safe at home in the kingdom of heav'n.
