# 1

I cannot drive the nails again,

I cannot thrust the spear of pain,

I cannot bear to see His grief and agony,

Repeating Calvary 

By tho't of sin,

Repeating Calvary  

By tho't of sin.



# 2

'Twas sin alone that nailed Him there,

'Twas love alone that made Him bear;

Sin's wage of death, our due,

Upon himself He drew

That we may live anew,

His glory share,

That we may live anew, 

His glory share.



# 3

His power frees from fetters strong,

All who confess and turn from wrong:

He could have shunned the pain.

Sin's pow'r would yet remain:

Now law and pardon reign, 

The angels' song, 

Now law and pardon reign, 

The angels' song.



# 4

My soul abhors His murd'rer sin,

No longer shall He dwell within;

But Christ, the living law,

Victor in holy war,

Enthroned forevermore,

Gives pow'r to win,

Enthroned forevermore,

Gives pow'r to win.
