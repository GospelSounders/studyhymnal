# 1

Working, O Christ, with Thee, working with Thee,

Unworthy, sinful, weak, though we may be;

Our all to Thee we give, for Thee alone we live,

And by Thy grace achieve, working with Thee.



# 2

Along the city’s waste, working with Thee,

Our eager footsteps haste, like Thee to be;

The poor we gather in, the outcasts raise from sin,

And labor souls to win, working with Thee.



# 3

Savior, we weary not, working with Thee,

As hard as Thine our lot can never be;

Our joy and comfort this, “Thy grace sufficent is;”

This changes toil to bliss, working with Thee.



# 4

So let us labor on, working with Thee,

Till earth to Thee is won, from sin set free;

Till men, from shore to shore, receive Thee, and adore,

And join us evermore, working with Thee.
