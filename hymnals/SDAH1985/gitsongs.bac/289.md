# 1

The Savior is waiting to enter your heart

Why don’t you let Him come in?

There’s nothing in this world to keep you apart

What is your answer to Him?



# Refrain

Time after time

He has waited before

And now He is waiting again

To see if you are willing

To open the door

Oh, how He wants to come in.



# 2

If you’ll take one step

Toward the Savior, my friend,

You’ll find His arms open wide.

Receive Him, and all of your darkness will end

Within your heart He’ll abide.
