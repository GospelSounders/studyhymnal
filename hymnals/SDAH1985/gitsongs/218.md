# 1

When He cometh, when He cometh

To make up His jewels,

All His jewels, precious jewels,

His loved and His own.



# Refrain

Like the stars of the morning,

His brightness adorning,

They shall shine in their beauty,

Bright gems for His crown.



# 2

He will gather, He will gather

The gems for His kingdom;

All the pure ones, all the bright ones,

His loved and His own.



# 3

Little children, little children,

Who love their Redeemer,

Are the jewels, precious jewels,

His loved and His own.
