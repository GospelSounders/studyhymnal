# 1

Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light,

And usher in the morning;

Ye shepherds, shrink not with affright,

But hear the angel’s warning.

This Child, now weak in infancy,

Our confidence and joy shall be,

The power of Satan breaking,

Our peace eternal making.



# 2

Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light,

To herald our salvation;

He stoops to earth – the God of might,

Our hope and expectation.

He comes in human flesh to dwell,

Our God with us, Immanuel,

The night of darkness ending,

Our fallen race befriending.
