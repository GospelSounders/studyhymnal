# 1

All who love and serve your city,

All who bear its daily stress,

All who cry for peace and justice,

All who curse and all who bless.



# 2

In your day of loss and sorrow,

In your day of helpless strife,

Honor, peace, and love retreating,

Seek the Lord, who is your life.



# 3

For all days are days of judgment,

And the Lord is waiting still,

Drawing near His friends who spurn Him,

Off’ring peace from Calv’ry’s hill.



# 4

Risen Lord, shall yet the city

Be the city of despair?

Come today, our judge, our glory;

Be its name “The Lord is there!”
