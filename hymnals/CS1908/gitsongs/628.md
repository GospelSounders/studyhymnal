# 1

Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!

Ye soldiers of the cross;

Lift high his royal banner,

It must not suffer loss:

From vict'ry unto vict'ry.

His army shall he lead.

Till ev'ry foe is vanquished,

And Christ is Lord indeed.



# 2

Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!

The trumpet call obey;

Forth to the mighty conflict,

In this his glorious day:

Ye that are men now serve him,

Against unnumbered foes;

Let courage rise with danger,

And strength to strength oppose.



# 3

Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!

Stand in his strength alone;

The arm of flesh will fail you;

Ye dare not trust your own:

Put on the gospel armor,

And, watching unto pray'r,

Where duty calls, or danger,

Be never wanting there.



# 4

Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!

The strife will not be long;

This day the noise of battle,

The next the victor's song:

To him that overcometh,

A crown of life shall be;

He with the King of Glory

Shall reign eternally.
