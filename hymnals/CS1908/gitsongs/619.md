# 1

The Church has one foundation,

'Tis Jesus Christ her Lord;

She is His new creation,

By water and the word;

From heav'n He came and sought her

To be His holy bride,

With His own blood He bo't her,

And for her life He died.



# 2

Elect from ev'ry nation,

Yet one o'er all the earth,

Her charter of salvation,

One Lord, one faith, one birth;

One holy name she blesses,

Partakes one holy food,

And to one hope she presses,

With ev'ry grace endued.



# 3

Tho' with a scornful wonder,

Men see her sore opprest,

Tho' foes would rend asunder

The rock where she doth rest;

Yet saints their faith are keeping,

Their cry goes up, "How long?"

And soon the night of weeping

Shall be the morn of song.



# 4

'Mid toil and tribulation,

And tumult of her war,

She waits the consummation

Of peace for ever more;

Till with the vision glorious

Her longing eyes are blest,

And the great Church victorious

Shall be the Church at rest.
