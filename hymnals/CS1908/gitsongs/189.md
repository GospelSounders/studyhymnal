# 1

They bro't their gifts to Jesus,

And laid them at his feet,

And love for this dear Saviour,

Made ev'ry off'ring sweet;

Good deeds and words of kindness,

Help for the poor of earth,

And not a gift among them

Was tho't of little worth.



Chorus:

Wouldst bring a gift to Jesus,

That he will count most sweet?

Say, "Lord, my heart I give thee,"

And lay it at his feet.



# 2

Apart from other givers

A poor wayfarer stood;

He saw the gifts they offered,

The poorest counted good,

And he was filled with longing,

A gift, tho' poor, to bring;

Alas!  all empty handed 

He stood before the King.  [Chorus]



# 3

"Dear Lord," he cried in sorrow,

"I know how kind thou art,

Take all I have to give thee,

My sinful, wayward heart."

Then Jesus answered softly,

"Count not the gift as small,

Tho' all of them are precious,

Thine is the best of all.  [Chorus]
