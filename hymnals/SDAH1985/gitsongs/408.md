# 1

Lord, enthroned in heav’nly splendor,

First begotten from the dead,

You alone, our strong defender,

Lifting up Your people’s head.

Alleluia, Jesus, true and living Bread!



# 2

Tho’ the lowliest form now veil You

As of old in Bethlehem,

Here as there Your angels hail You

Branch and flow’r of Jesse’s stem.

Alleluia, We in worship join with them.



# 3

Paschal Lamb, Your off’ring finished

Once for all when You were slain,

In its fullness undiminished

Shall forever more remain.

Alleluia, Cleansing souls from every stain.



# 4

Life imparting heav’nly manna,

Stricken rock with streaming side,

Heav’n and earth with loud hosanna

Worship You the Lamb who died.

Alleluia, Ris’n, ascended, glorified!
