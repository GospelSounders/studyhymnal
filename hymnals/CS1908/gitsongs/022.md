# 1

If you could see Christ standing here tonight,

His thorn-crown'd head and pierced hands could view;

Could see those eyes that beam with heavn's own light,

And hear Him say, "Beloved, 'twas for you:"



Chorus:

Would you believe, and Jesus receive,

If He were standing here?

Would you believe, and Jesus receive,

If He were standing here?



# 2

If you could see that face so calm and sweet,

Those lips that spake words only pure and true;

Could see the nail prints in His tender feet,

And hear Him say, "Beloved, 'twas for you:"  [Chorus]



# 3

He whispers to your heart, turn not away,

For He's beside you, in your narrow pew;

If you will listen, you will hear Him say 

In loving tones "Beloved, 'twas for you."  [Chorus]
