# 1

What child is this, who, laid to rest,

On Mary`s lap is sleeping?

Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,

While shepherds watch are keeping?



# Refrain

This, this is Christ the King,

Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:

Haste, haste to bring Him laud,

The babe, the son of Mary.



# 2

Why lies He in such mean estate

Where ox and ass are feeding?

Good Christian, fear: for sinners here

The silent Word is pleading.



# 3

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,

Come, peasant, king, to own Him,

The King of kings salvation brings,

Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
