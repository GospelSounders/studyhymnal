# 1

The Lord be with us as we bend

His blessing to receive;

His gift of peace upon us send,

Before his courts we leave.



# 2

The Lord be with us as we walk

Along our homeward road;

In silent thought or friendly talk

Our hearts be still with God.



# 3

The Lord be with us till the night

Enfold us all to rest;

Be he of ev'ry heart the light,

Of ev'ry home the guest.
