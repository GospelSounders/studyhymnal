# 1

While in sweet communion feeding

On this earthly bread and wine,

Saviour, may we see thee bleeding

On the cross, to make us thine.

Tho' unseen, Lord, thou art near us,

With thy still small voice of love;

Whisper words of peace to cheer us,

Ev'ry doubt and fear remove.



# 2

Bring before us all the story

Of thy life, and death of woe;

And, with hopes of endless glory,

Wean our hearts from all below.

Draw us nearer and still nearer

To thy pierc'd and bleeding side,

Till our view of self grows clearer

In the light of Him who died.
