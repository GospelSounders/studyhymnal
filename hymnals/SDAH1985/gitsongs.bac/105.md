# 1

Sing to the great Jehovah’s praise!

All praise to Him belongs;

Who kindly lengthens out our days,

In spires our choicest songs,

Inspires our choicest songs.



# 2

His providence hath brought us through

Another various year;

We all, with vows and anthems new,

Before our God appear,

Before our God appear.



# 3

O God, Thy mercies past we own,

And Thy continued care;

To Thee presenting through Thy Son

What e’er we have and are,

What e’er we have and are.
