# 1

Now just a word for Jesus;

Your dearest Friend so true,

Come, cheer our hearts and tell us

What He has done for you.



Refrain:

Now just a word for Jesus

'Twill help us on our way;

One little word for Jesus,

O speak, or sing, or pray.



# 2

Now just a word for Jesus;

You feel your sins forgiv'n,

And by His grace are striving

To reach a home in heav'n.  [Refrain]



# 3

Now just a word for Jesus;

A cross it cannot be

To say, "I love my Saviour

Who gave His life for me"  [Refrain]



# 4

Now just a word for Jesus;

Let not the time be lost;

The heart's neglected duty

Brings sorrow to its cost.  [Refrain]



# 5

Now just a word for Jesus;

And if your faith be dim,

Arise in all your weakness,

And leave the rest to Him.  [Refrain]
