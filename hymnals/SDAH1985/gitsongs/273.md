# 1

Lord, I have made Thy word my choice,

My lasting heritage;

There shall my noblest powers rejoice,

My warmest thoughts engage.



# 2

I’ll read the histories of Thy love,

And keep Thy laws in sight;

While through Thy promises I rove,

With ever fresh delight.



# 3

In this broad land of wealth unknown,

Where springs of life arise,

Seeds of immortal bliss are sown,

And hidden glory lies.



# 4

The best relief that mourners have,

It makes our sorrows blest;

Our fairest hope beyond the grave,

And our eternal rest.
