# 1

Look for the beautiful, look for the true;

Sunshine and shadow are all around you;

Looking at evil we grope in the night,

Looking at Jesus we walk in the light,

Look for the beautiful, honor the right.



# 2

Think of the beautiful, think of the true;

Thoughts like an avalanche sweep over you;

Keep not the multitude, sort them with care,

Testing by purity, purging by pray'r;

Think of the beautiful, think of the fair.



# 3

Talk of the beautiful, talk of the true;

Tongues full of poison are whisp'ring to you;

Answer them not with a talebearing word,

Only in blessing the voice should be heard;

Talk of the beautiful, talk of thy Lord.



# 4

Live for the beautiful, love for the true,

Lifting the fallen as Christ lifted you;

Search for the jewels imbedded in sin,

Bring them to Jesus, his blood washes clean;

Live for the beautiful, keep love within.
