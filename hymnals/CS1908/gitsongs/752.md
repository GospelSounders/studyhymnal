1.

Soldiers of Christ, arise,

And put your armor on;

Fight, for the battle will be ours;

We fight to win a crown.



2.

We fight not against flesh,

We wrestle not with blood;

But principalities and pow'rs,

And for the truth of God;



3.

With wicked spirits, too,

That in high places stand,

Perverting oft the word of God,

And say 'tis by command.
