1.

O Paradise!  O Paradise!

Who doth not crave for rest?

Who would not seek the happy land

Where they that love are blest?



Refrain:

Where loyal hearts and true

Stand ever in the light,

All rapture thro' and thro',

In God's most holy sigh.



2.

O Paradise!  O Paradise!

The world is growing old;

Who would not be at rest and free

Where love is never cold?  [Refrain]



3.

O Paradise!  O Paradise!

I want to sin no more;

I want to be as pure on earth

As on thy spotless shore.  [Refrain]



4.

O Paradise!  O Paradise!

I would so faithful be,

That when my race on earth has run

That race may end in thee.  [Refrain]
