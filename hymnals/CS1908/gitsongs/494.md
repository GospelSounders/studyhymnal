# 1

The cross that he gave may be heavy,

But it ne'er outweighs His grace;

The storm that I fear may surround me,

But it ne'er excludes His face.



Chorus:

The cross is not greater than His grace,

The storm cannot hide His blessed face;

I am satisfied to know

That with Jesus here below,

I can conquer ev'ry foe.



# 2

The thorns in my path are not sharper

Than composed his crown for me;

The cup that I drink not more bitter

Than he drank in Gethsemane.  [Chorus]



# 3

The light of his love shineth brighter,

As it falls on paths of woe;

The toil of my work groweth lighter,

As I stoop to raise the low.  [Chorus]



# 4

His will I have joy in fulfilling,

As I'm walking in his sight;

My all to the blood I am bringing,

It alone can keep me right.  [Chorus]
