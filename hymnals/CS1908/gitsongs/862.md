1.

In the land of fadeless day,

Lies "the city four-square,"

It shall never pass away,

And there is "no night there.



Chorus:

God shall "wipe away all tears;"

There's no death, no pain, nor fears;

And they count not time by years,

For there is "no night there."



2.

All the gates of pearl are made,

In "the city four-square,"

All the streets with gold are laid,

And there is "no night there."  [Chorus]



3.

And the gates shall never close

To "the city four-square,"

There life's crystal river flows,

And there is "no night there."  [Chorus]



4.

There they need no sunshine bright,

In "that city four-square,"

For the Lamb is all the light,

And there is "no night there."  [Chorus]
