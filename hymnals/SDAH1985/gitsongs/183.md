# 1

I Will sing of Jesus love,

Sing of Him,who first loved me;

for He left bright worlds above,

And died on Calvary.



# Refrain

I will sing of Jesus love

Endless praise my heart shall give;

He has died that I might live

I will sing His love to me.



# 2

O the depths of love divine!

Earth or heaven can never know

How that sin as dark as mine

can be made as white as snow.



# 3

Nothing good for Him I’ve done;

How could He such love bestow?

Lord, I own my heart is won,

help me now my love to show.
