# 1

The waters are troubled,

The angel is here;

The fountain of mercy

Flows healing and clear:

O come in your sorrow,

And come in your sin;

The waters are troubled:

Step in, O step in!



# 2

The waters are troubled,

No longer delay;

The fountain of mercy

Has healing today;

Then why will you linger,

Since lift you may win?

The waters are troubled:

Step in, O step in!



# 3

The waters are troubled

The angel still waits;

He pauses in peril

Who halts and debates,

Give over your falt'ring,

Your struggles within;

The waters are troubled:

Step in, O step in!
