756 â€“ Kindred Minds


1.
How blest the sacred tie that binds
In sweet communion kindred minds!
How swift the heav'nly course they run,
Whose hearts, whose faith, whose hopes are one.

2.
To each the soul of each how dear!
What tender love!  what holy fear!
How does the gen'rous flame within
Refine from earth and cleanse from sin!

3.
Their streaming eyes together flow
For human guilt and human woe;
Their ardent prayers together rise,
Like mingling flames in sacrifice.
