# 1

Blest be the tie that binds

Our hearts in Christian love!

The fellowship of kindred minds

Is like to that above.



# 2

Before our Father's throne

We pour our ardent pray'rs;

Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,

Our comforts and our cares.



# 3

We share our mutual woes,

Our mutual burdens bear;

And often for each other flows

The sympathizing tear.



# 4

When we asunder part,

It gives us inward pain;

But we shall still be joined in heart

And hope to meet again.
