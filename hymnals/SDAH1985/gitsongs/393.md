# 1

Lord of the Sabbath and its light,

I hail Thy hallowed day of rest;

It is my weary soul’s delight,

The solace of my careworn breast,

The solace of my careworn breast.



# 2

O sacred day of peace and joy,

Thy hours are ever dear to me;

Ne’er may a sinful thought destroy

The holy calm I find in thee,

The holy calm I find in thee.



# 3

How sweetly now they glide along!

How hallowed is the calm they yield!

Transporting is their rapturous song,

And heavenly visions seem revealed,

And heavenly visions seem revealed.



# 4

O Jesus, let me ever hail

Thy presence with the day of rest;

Then will Thy servant never fail

To deem Thy Sabbath doubly blest,

To deem Thy Sabbath doubly blest.
