# 1

O for a heart to praise my God,

A heart from sin set free,

A heart that always feels Thy blood

So freely shed for me.



# 2

A heart resigned, submissive, meek,

My dear Redeemer’s throne,

Where only Christ is heard to speak,

Where Jesus reigns alone.



# 3

A heart in every thought renewed

And full of love divine,

Perfect and right and pure and good,

A copy, Lord, of Thine.



# 4

Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;

Come quickly from above;

Write Thy new name upon my heart,

Thy new, best name of Love.
