# 1

Standing on the promises of Christ my King,

Thru eternal ages let His praises ring;

Glory in the highest I will shout and sing,

Standing on the promises of God.



# Refrain

Standing, standing,

Standing on the promises

of God my Savior;

Standing, standing,

I’m standing on the promises of God.



# 2

Standing on the promises that cannot fail,

When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,

By the living word of God I shall prevail,

Standing on the promises of God.



# 3

Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,

Bound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord,

Overcoming daily with the Spirit’s sword,

Standing on the promises of God.
