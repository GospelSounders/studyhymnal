# 1

This is the threefold truth

On which our faith depends;

And with this joyful cry

Worship begins and ends;



# Refrain

Christ has died!

Christ is risen!

Christ will come again!



# 2

By this we are upheld

When doubt and grief assails

Our Christian fortitude,

And only grace avails.



# Refrain

Christ has died!

Christ is risen!

Christ will come again!



# 3

This is the threefold truth

Which, if we hold it fast,

Changes the world and us

And brings us home at last.



# Refrain

Christ has died!

Christ is risen!

Christ will come again!
