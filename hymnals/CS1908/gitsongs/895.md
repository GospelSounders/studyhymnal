1.

Joy to the world, the Lord will come!

Let earth receive her King;

Let ev'ry heart prepare him room,

And heav'n and nature sing,

And heav'n and nature sing,

And heav'n, and heav'n and nature sing.



2.

Joy to the earth, the Lord will reign!

Let men their songs employ;

While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains,

Repeat the sounding joy,

Repeat the sounding joy,

Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.



3.

Soon will he rule the earth with grace,

And make the nations prove

The glories of his righteousness,

And wonders of his love,

And wonders of his love,

And won- and wonders of his love.
