# 1

In the silent midnight watches,

List thy bosom's door!

How it knocketh, knocketh, knocketh,

Knocketh, evermore!

Say not 'tis thy pulses beating,

'Tis thy heart of sin;

'Tis thy Saviour knock, and crieth,

"Rise and let me in!'



# 2

Death comes down with reckless footsteps,

To the hall and hut;

Think you death will tarry knocking,

When the door is shut?

Jesus waiteth, waiteth, waiteth;

But the door is fast;

Grieved away thy Saviour goeth,

Death breaks in at last.



# 3

Vainly thou wilt stand entreating 

Christ to let thee in,

At the gate of mercy beating,

Wailing for thy sin!

Nay!  alas, O guilty sinner! 

Hast thou then forgot?

Jesus waited long to know thee,

Now he knows thee not!
