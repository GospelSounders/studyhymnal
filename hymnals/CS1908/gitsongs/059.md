# 1

Who is on the Lord's side?

Always true;

There's a right and wrong side,

Where stand you?



Chorus:

Choose now, 

Choose now,

On the right or wrong side?

False or true?

Choose now,

Choose now,

On the right or wrong side?

Where stand you?



# 2

Thousands on the wrong side

Choose to stand;

Still 'tis not the strong side,

True and grand.  [Chorus]



# 3

Come and join the Lord's side;

Ask you why?

'Tis the only safe side 

By and by.  [Chorus]
