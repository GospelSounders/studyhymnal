# 1

Sound, sound the truth abroad!

Bear ye the word of God

Through the wide world;

Tell what our Lord has done,

Tell how the day is won,

And from his lofty throne

Satan is hurled.



# 2

Ye who, forsaking all

At your loved Master's call,

Comforts resign;

Soon will your work be done,

Soon will the prize be won;

Brighter than yonder sun

Then shall ye shine.
