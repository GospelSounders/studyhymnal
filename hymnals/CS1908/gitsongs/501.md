# 1

Jesus bids us shine with a pure, clear light,

Like a little candle burning in the night;

In this world of darkness we must shine,

You in your corner, I in mine.



# 2

Jesus bids us shine thro' the gloom around,

Many kinds of darkness in this world are found;

Sin, and want, and sorrow; so we shine,

You in your corner, I in mine.



# 3

When we shine for others we shine for Him,

Well He sees and knows it if our light is dim;

He looks down from heaven, sees us shine,

You in your corner, I in mine.



# 4

Jesus is a bright light of love divine,

When on Him we're looking, then it is we shine,

Like the silver moon, with borrowed light,

Each in his corner, doing right.
