# 1

O Love that will not let me go,

I rest my weary soul in Thee;

I give Thee back the life I owe,

That in thine ocean depths its flow

May richer, fuller be!



# 2

O Light that followest all my way,

I yield my flick'ring torch to Thee;

My heart restores its borrowed ray,

That in Thy sunshine's glow its day

May brighter, fairer be!



# 3

O Joy that seekest me thro' pain,

I cannot close my heart to Thee;

I trace the rainbow thro' the rain,

And feel the promise is not vain,

That morn's shall tearless be!



# 4

O cross that liftest up my head,

I dare not ask to hide from thee;

I lay in dust life's glory dead,

And from the ground there blossom red,

Life that shall endless be!
