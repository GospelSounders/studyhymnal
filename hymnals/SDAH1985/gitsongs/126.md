# 1

In the bleak midwinter

Frosty wind made moan;

Earth stood hard as iron,

Water like a stone;

Snow had fallen, snow on snow,

Snow on snow,

In the bleak midwinter,

Long ago.



# 2

Angels and archangels

May have gathered there,

Cherubim and seraphim

Thronged the air:

But His mother only

In her maiden bliss,

Worshipped the beloved

With a kiss.



# 3

What can I give Him,

Poor as I am?

If I were a shepherd

I would bring a lamb;

If I were a wise man

I would do my part;

Yet what can I give Him?

Give my heart.
