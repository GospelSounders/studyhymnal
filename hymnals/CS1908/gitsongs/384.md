# 1

Break Thou the bread of life,

Dear Lord, to me,

As Thou didst break the loaves

Beside the sea;

Beyond the sacred page

I seek Thee, Lord;

My spirit pants for Thee,

O living Word!



# 2

Bless Thou the truth, revealed

This day to me,

As Thou didst bless the bread

By Galilee;

Then shall all bondage cease,

All fetters fall;

And I shall find in Thee

My All-in-All!



# 3

Spirit and Life are they,

Words Thou dost speak;

I hasten to obey,

But I am weak;

Thou art my only help,

Thou art my life;

Heeding Thy holy word

I win the strife.
