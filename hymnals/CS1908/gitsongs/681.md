# 1

A mighty fortress is our God,

A bulwark never failing;

Our helper he, amid the flood

Of mortal ills prevailing.

For still our ancient foe

Doth seek to work his woe;

His craft and pow'r are great,

And arm'd with cruel hate;

On earth is not his equal.



# 2

Did we in our own strength confide,

Our striving would be losing;

Were not the right Man on our side,

The Man of God's own choosing.

Doth ask who that may be?

Christ Jesus, it is he!

Lord Sabaoth is his name,

From age to age the same;

And he must win the battle.



# 3

And tho' this world, with devils filled,

Should threaten to undo us,

We will not fear, for God hath will'd

His truth to triumph thro' us.

Let goods and kindred go,

This mortal life also;

The body they may kill;

God's truth abideth still,

His kingdom is forever.
