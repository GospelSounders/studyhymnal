# 1

Oh, bliss of the purified!  bliss of the free!

I plunge in the crimson tide open for me!

O'er sin and uncleanness exulting I stand,

And point to the print of the nails in His hand.



Chorus:

Oh, sing of His mighty love,

Sing of His mighty love,

Sing of His mighty love

Mighty to save!



# 2

Oh, bliss of the purified!  Jesus is mine,

In dread condemnation, no longer I pine;

In conscious salvation I sing of His grace,

Who lifted upon me the smile of His face!  [Chorus]



# 3

Oh, bliss of the purified!  bliss of the pure!

No wound hath the soul that His blood cannot cure;

No head sorrow bowed but may sweetly find rest,

No tears but may vanish on His loving breast.  [Chorus]



# 4

Oh, Jesus, the Crucified!  Thee will I sing!

My blessed redeemer!  my God and my King! 

My soul filled with rapture, shall shout o'er the grave,

And triumph at death in the "Mighty to Save!"  [Chorus]
