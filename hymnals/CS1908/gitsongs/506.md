# 1

O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,

My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;

So sinful, so weary, Thine, thine would I be;

Thou blest "Rock of Ages," I'm hiding in Thee.



Chorus:

Hiding in Thee,

Hiding in Thee, 

Thou blest "Rock of Ages,"

I'm hiding in Thee.



# 2

In the calm of the noon tide, in sorrow's lone hour,

In times when temptation casts o'er me its power;

In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea;

Thou blest "Rock of Ages," I'm hiding in Thee.  [Chorus]



# 3

How oft in the conflict, when press'd by the foe,

I have fled to my Refuge and breath'd out my woe;

How often, when trials like sea billows roll,

Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.  [Chorus]
