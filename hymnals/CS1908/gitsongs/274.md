# 1

Strains of music often greet me,

As I join the busy throng,

But there's nothing half so pleasant,

As the holy Sabbath song.



Chorus:

No fear of ill, no fear or wrong,

While I can sing my Sabbath song:

My Sabbath song, my Sabbath song,

I love to sing my Sabbath song.



# 2

'Tis a song of love and mercy,

Speaking peace to all mankind,

Telling sinners poor and needy,

Where the Saviour they may find.  [Chorus]



# 3

While I love, O may I ever

Love the holy Sabbath song,

And in yonder home eternal, 

Sing it with the blood bought throng.  [Chorus]
