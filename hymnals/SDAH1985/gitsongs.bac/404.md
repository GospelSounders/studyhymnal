# 1

Now let us from this table rise

Renewed in body, mind, and soul;

With Christ we die and live again,

His selfless love has made us whole.



# 2

With minds alert, upheld by grace,

To spread the word in speech and deed,

We follow in the steps of Christ,

At one with all in hope and need.



# 3

To fill each human house with love,

It is the sacrament of care;

The work that Christ began to do

We humbly pledge ourselves to share.



# 4

Then grant us courage, Father God,

To choose again the pilgrim way

And help us to accept with joy

The challenge of tomorrow’s day.
