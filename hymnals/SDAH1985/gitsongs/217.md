# 1

The church has waited long

Her absent Lord to see;

And still in loneliness she waits,

A friendless stranger she.



# 2

How long, O Lord our God,

Holy and true and good,

Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering church,

Her sighs and tears and blood?



# 3

We long to hear Thy voice,

To see Thee face to face,

To share Thy crown and glory then,

As now we share Thy grace.



# 4

Come, Lord, and wipe away

The curse, the sin, the stain,

And make this blighted world of ours

Thine own fair world again.
