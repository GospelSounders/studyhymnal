# 1

There was One who was willing to die in my stead,

That a soul, so unworthy, might live,

And the path to the cross He was willing to tread,

All the sins of my life to forgive.



Refrain:

They are nailed to the cross,

They are nailed to the cross,

O how much He was willing to bear!

With what anguish and loss,

Jesus went to the cross!

And He carried my sins with Him there.



# 2

He is tender and loving and patient with me,

While He cleanses my heart of its dross,

But "there's no condemnation" I know I am free,

For my sins are all nailed to the cross.  [Refrain]



# 3

I will cling to my Saviour and never depart

I will joyfully journey each day,

With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,

That my sins have been taken away.  [Refrain]
