# 1

A diligent and grateful heart

Prompts me to sing Thy praise.

Thy love and mercies from the start

Have blessed me all my days.



# 2

I thank Thee for the means to serve

With talents and with tithes,

For sharing brings the utmost joy

When lifting other lives.



# 3

My thanks I give you for stewardship

To minister through deeds,

To serve and share with patient care

Thy people in their needs.



# 4

O Lord, I dedicate my all

In this response to Thee.

Help me to magnify this call

In deep humility.
