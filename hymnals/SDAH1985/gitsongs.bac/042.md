# 1

Now that the daylight fills the sky,

We lift our hearts to God on high,

That He, in all we do or say,

Would keep us free from harm today;



# 2

Would guard our hearts and tongues from strife;

From anger’s din would shield our life;

From evil sights would turn our eyes,

And close our ears to vanities;



# 3

So we, when this new day is gone

And night in turn is drawing on,

With conscience by the world unstained

Shall praise His name for vict’ry gained.



# 4

“All praise to You, creator Lord!

All praise to You, eternal Word!

All praise to You, O Spirit wise!”

We sing as daylight fills the skies.
