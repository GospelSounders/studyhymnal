# 1

The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?

By day and by night his presence is near;

He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;

This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.



Chorus:

The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;

By day and by night he leads me along.

The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;

By day and by night he leads me along.



# 2

The Lord is my light; tho' clouds may arise,

Faith stronger than sight, looks up to the skies

Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign;

Then how can I ever in darkness remain?  [Chorus]



# 3

The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength,

I know in his might I'll conquer at length;

My weakness in mercy he covers with pow'r,

And, walking by faith, he upholds me each hour.  [Chorus]



# 4

The Lord is my light, my all and in all;

There is in his sight no darkness at all;

He is my Redeemer, my Saviour and King;

With saints and with angels his praises I sing.  [Chorus]
