# 1

Praise ye the Father for his loving kindness,

Tenderly cares he for his erring children;

Praise him, ye angels, praise him in the heavens,

Praise ye Jehovah!



# 2

Praise ye the Saviour, great is his compassion,

Graciously cares he for his chosen people;

Young men and maidens, ye old men and children,

Praise ye the Savior!



# 3

Praise ye the Spirit, Comforter of Israel,

Sent of the Father and the Son to bless us;

Praise ye the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,

Praise the Eternal Three!
