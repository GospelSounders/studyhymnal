# 1

More like Jesus would I be;

Let my Saviour dwell with me,

Fill my soul with peace and love,

Make me gentle as a dove;

More like Jesus while I go,

Pilgrim in this world below;

Poor in Spirit would I be

Let my Saviour dwell in me.



# 2

If he hears the raven's cry;

If his ever watchful eye

Marks the sparrows when they fall,

Surely he will hear my call,

He will teach me how to live,

All my simple tho'ts forgive;

Pure in heart I still would be

Let my Saviour dwell in me.



# 3

More like Jesus when I pray,

More like Jesus day by day;

May I rest me by his side,

Where the tranquil waters glide;

Born of him, thro' grace renew'd,

By his love my will subdued,

Rich in faith I still would be

Let my Saviour dwell in me.
