# 1

Lo, how a rose e’re blooming

From tenderstem hath sprung,

Of Jesse’s lineage coming

As men of old have sung.

It came, a floweret bright,

Amid the cold of winter

When half spent was the night.



# 2

Isaiah ’twas foretold it,

The Rose I have in mind,

With Mary we beheld it,

The virgin mother kind.

To show God’s love aright

She bore to them a Savior,

When half spent was the night.
