# 1

Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,

By His presence all divine?

True and tender, pure and precious,

Oh, how blest to call Him mine!



# Refrain

All that thrills my soul is Jesus;

He is more than life to me; (to me;)

And the fairest of ten thousand,

In my blessed Lord I see.



# 2

Love of Christ so freely given,

Grace of God beyond degree,

Mercy higher than the heaven,

Deeper than the deepest sea.



# 3

Every need His hand supplying,

Every good in Him I see;

On His strength divine relying,

He is All in All to me.



# 4

By the crystal flowing river

With the ransomed I will sing,

And forever and forever

Praise and glorify the King.
