# 1

I must have the Saviour with me,

For I dare not walk alone;

I must feel His presence near me,

And His arm around me thrown.



Chorus:

Then my soul shall fear no ill,

Let Him lead me where He will,

I will go without a murmur,

And His footsteps follow still.



# 2

I must have the Saviour with me,

For my faith, at best, is weak;

He can whisper words of comfort

That no other voice can speak.  [Chorus]



# 3

I must have the Saviour with me,

In the onward march of life, 

Thro' the tempest and the sunshine,

Thro' the battle and the strife.  [Chorus]



# 4

I must have the Saviour with me,

And His eye the way must guide,

Till I reach the vale of Jordan,

Till I gain the other side.  [Chorus]
