# 1

O Love that wilt not let me go,

I rest my weary soul in thee;

I give thee back the life I owe,

that in thine ocean depths

its flow may richer, fuller be.



# 2

O Light that followest all my way,

I yield my flickering torch to thee;

my heart restores its borrowed ray,

that in they sunshine’s blaze

its day may brighter, fairer be.



# 3

O Joy that seekest me through pain,

I cannot close my heart to thee;

I trace the rainbow thru the rain,

and feel the promise is not vain,

that morn shall tearless be.



# 4

O Cross that liftest up my head,

I dare not ask to fly from thee;

I lay in dust life’s glory dead,

and from the ground there blossoms

red life that shall endless be.
