# 1

Revive Thy work, O Lord, Thy mighty arm make bare;

Speak with the voice that wakes the dead, and make Thy people hear.



# 2

Revive Thy work, O Lord, disturb this sleep of death;

Quicken the smould'ring embers now by Thine almighty breath.



# 3

Revive Thy work, O Lord, create soul-thirst for Thee;

And hung'ring for the bread of life, oh, may our spirits be.



# 4

Revive Thy work, O Lord, exalt Thy precious name;

And by the Holy Ghost our love for Thee and Thine inflame.
