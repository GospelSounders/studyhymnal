# 1

I hear thy welcome voice,

That calls me, Lord, to thee;

For cleansing in thy precious blood,

That flow'd on Calvary.



Chorus:

I am coming, Lord!

Coming now to thee!

Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood

That flow'd on Calvary.



# 2

Tho' coming weak and vile,

Thou dost my strength assure;

Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,

Till spotless all, and pure.  [Chorus]



# 3

'Tis Jesus calls me on

To perfect faith and love,

To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,

For earth and heav'n above.  [Chorus]



# 4

All hail, atoning blood!

All hail, redeeming grace!

All hail!  the gift of Christ, our Lord,

Our Strength and Righteousness.  [Chorus]
