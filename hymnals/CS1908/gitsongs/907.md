1.

Shall we gather at the river

Where bright angel feet have trod;

With its crystal tide forever

Flowing by the throne of God?



Chorus:

Yes, we'll gather at the river,

The beautiful, the beautiful river;

Gather with the saints at the river

That flows by the throne of God.



# 2

On the margin of the river,

Washing up its silver spray,

We will walk and worship ever,

All the happy golden day.  [Chorus]



3.

Ere we reach the shining river,

Lay we ev'ry burden down;

Grace our spirits will deliver,

And provide a robe and crown  [Chorus]



4.

Soon we'll reach the shining river,

Soon our pilgrimage will cease,

Soon our happy hearts will quiver

With that melody of peace.  [Chorus]
