# 1

O Jesus, thou art standing,

outside the fast closed door,

in lowly patience waiting

to pass the threshold o’er:

O shame, professing Christians,

his Name and sign who bear,

O shame, thrice shame upon us,

to keep him standing there!



# 2

O Jesus, thou art knocking;

and lo, that hand is scarred,

and thorns thy brow encircle,

and tears thy face have marred:

O love that passeth knowledge,

so patiently to wait!

O sin that hath no equal,

so fast to bar the gate!



# 3

O Jesus, thou art pleading

in accents meek and low,

“I died for you, my children,

and will you treat me so?”

O Lord, with shame and sorrow

we open now the door;

dear Savior, enter, enter,

and leave us never more.
