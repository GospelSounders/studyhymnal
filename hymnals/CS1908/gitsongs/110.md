# 1

O now I see the crimson wave,

The fountain deep and wide;

Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,

Points to his wounded side.



Refrain:

The cleansing stream I see, I see,

I plunge, and now it cleanseth me!

O praise the Lord!  it cleanseth me,

It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.



# 2

I see the new creation rise,

I hear the speaking blood;

It speaks,--polluted nature dies,

Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.  [Refrain]



# 3

I rise to walk in heav'n's own light,

Above the world and sin;

With heart made pure and garments white,

And Christ enthroned within.  [Refrain]



# 4

Amazing grace!  'tis heav'n below,

To feel the blood applied,

And Jesus, only Jesus, know,

My Jesus crucified.  [Refrain]
