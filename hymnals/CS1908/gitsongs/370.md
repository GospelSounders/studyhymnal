# 1

Fling out the banner!  let it float

Skyward and seaward, high and wide;

Our glory only in the cross;

Our only hope, the Crucified.



# 2

Fling out the banner!  angels bend

In anxious silence o'er the sign,

And vainly seek to comprehend

The wonder of the love Divine.



# 3

Fling out the banner!  sin-sick souls,

That sink and perish in the strife,

Shall touch in faith its radiant hem,

And spring immortal into life.



# 4

Fling out the banner!  wide and high,

Seaward and skyward, let it shine:

Nor skill, nor might, nor merit ours;

We conquer only in that sign.
