# 1

Jesus, Friend of little children,

Be a friend to me;

Take my hand and ever keep me

Close to Thee.



# 2

Teach me how to grow in goodness,

Daily as I grow;

Thou hast been a child, and surely

Thou dost know.



# 3

Step by step, O, lead me onward,

Upward into youth;

Wiser, stronger, still becoming

In Thy truth.



# 4

Never leave me, nor forsake me;

Ever be my friend;

For I need Thee from life’s dawning

To its end.
