# 1

Loyalty to the Master, loyalty to the King,

Loyalty now and ever, cheerfully let us sing;

Wholly at His commandment let ev'ry soldier be,

Joyfully serving Jesus, serving with loyalty.



Chorus:

Loyal soldiers, let us joyfully march along,

Forward, forward, with a triumphant song;



# 2

Loyalty to the Master, letting Him lead the way,

Glorious is His banner, follow it ev'ry day;

Into the midst of battle, conquering as we go,

Victory He has promised over the deadly foe.  [Chorus]



# 3

Loyalty to the Master, looking to Him alone,

Turning away from evil, Jesus will keep His own;

Onward, still onward pressing, seeing the starry prize

Waiting for all the faithful, meeting beyond the skies.  [Chorus]
