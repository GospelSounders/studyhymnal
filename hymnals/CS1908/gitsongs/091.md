# 1

There is a gate that stands ajar,

And thro' its portals gleaming,

A radiance from the cross afar,

The Saviour's love revealing.



Chorus:

O depth of mercy!  can it be

That gate was left ajar for me?

For me, for me?

Was left ajar for me?



# 2

That gate ajar stands free for all

Who seek thro' it salvation;

The rich and poor, the great and small,

Of ev'ry tribe and nation.  [Chorus]



# 3

Press onward, then, tho' foes may frown;

While mercy's gate is open

Accept the cross, and win the crown,

Love's everlasting token.  [Chorus]



# 4

Beyond the river's brink we'll lay

The cross that here is given,

And bear the crown of life away,

And love Him more in heaven.  [Chorus]
