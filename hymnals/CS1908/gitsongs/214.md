# 1

Awake, my soul, and greet the dawn,

Behold, the dreary night is gone;

The sunless grave gives back its prey,

For Christ came forth at break of day.



Chorus:

Awake, my soul,

The Saviour lives, no more to die,

Awake, my soul, 

The Lord ascends on high.



# 2

Amazed were they, the Roman guard,

Who fast the sepulcher had barred,

To see how vain the watch the seal,

When Jesus did his might reveal.  [Chorus]



# 3

In lofty strains let Zion sing

The praise of her triumphant King;

Captivity is captive led,

For Christ is risen from the dead.  [Chorus]
