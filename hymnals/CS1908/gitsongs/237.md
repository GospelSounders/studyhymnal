# 1

I sing the love of God, my Father,

Whose Spirit abides within,

Who changes all my grief to gladness,

And pardons me all my sin.

Tho' clouds may lower, dark and dreary,

Yet He has promised to be near;

He gives me sunshine for my shadow,

And "beauty for ashes," here. 

He gives me joy in place of sorrow;

He gives me love that casts out fear;

He gives me sunshine for my shadow,

And "beauty for ashes," here.



# 2

I sing the love of Christ, my Saviour,

Who suffer'd upon the tree,

That in the secret of His presence,

My bondage might freedom be.

He comes "to bind the broken hearted;"

He comes the fainting soul to cheer;

He gives me "oil of joy" for mourning,

And "beauty for ashes," here.

He gives me joy in place of sorrow;

He gives me love that casts out fear;

He gives me sunshine for my shadow,

And "beauty for ashes," here.



# 3

I sing the beauty of the Gospel

That scatters not thorns, but flow'rs,

That bids me scatter smiles and sunbeams

Wherever are lonely hours.

The "garment of His praise" it offers

For "heaviness of spirit," drear;

It gives me sunshine for my shadow,

And "beauty for ashes," here.

He gives me joy in place of sorrow;

He gives me love that casts out fear;

He gives me sunshine for my shadow,

And "beauty for ashes," here.
