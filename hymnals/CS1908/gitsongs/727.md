# 1

Oh, where are kings and empires now,

Of old that went and came?

But, Lord, Thy Church is living yet,

Thro' ages still the same.



# 2

We mark her goodly battlements,

And her foundations strong;

We hear within the solemn voice

Of her unending song.



# 3

For not like kingdoms of the world

Thy holy church, O God!

They change with changing words of men;

She rests upon Thy word.



# 4

Unshaken as eternal hills,

When on Thy truth she stands,

A mountain that shall fill the earth,

A house not made by hands.
