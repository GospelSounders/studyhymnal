# 1

I hear Thy welcome voice,

That calls me, Lord, to Thee;

For cleansing in Thy precious blood,

That flowed on Calvary.



# Refrain

I am coming, Lord!

Coming now to Thee!

Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood

That flowed on Calvary.



# 2

Though coming weak and vile,

Thou dost my strength assure;

Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,

Till spotless all, and pure.



# 3

‘Tis Jesus calls me on

To perfect faith and love,

To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,

For earth and heaven above.



# 4

All hail, atoning blood!

All hail, redeeming grace!

All hail! the gift of Christ, our Lord,

Our Strength and Righteousness.
