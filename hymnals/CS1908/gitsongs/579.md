# 1

If I were a sunbeam,

This is what I'd do,

I'd find the dark places,

Searching the forest through;

I would kiss the pale flowers,

Bending low at my feet,

Till each lonely blossom

Open'd fair and sweet.



Chorus:

Beautiful sunbeam!

God sent you here;

I'll be a sunbeam,

Lonely hearts to cheer.



# 2

So many dark places

In this world of sin,

Why not be a sunbeam,

Letting the love light in,

God's beautiful love light,

Smiles and words of cheer;

Kindness is the sunshine

We should scatter here.  [Chorus]



# 3

If we are like Jesus

Sun of Righteousness

Who left the bright mansions,

Lonely lives to bless,

'Twill be sweetest pleasure

Of his love to tell,

Shining out his gladness

Where the sad ones dwell.  [Chorus]
