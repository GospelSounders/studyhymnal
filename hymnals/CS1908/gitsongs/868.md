1.

Are you ready for the Bridegroom

When he comes, when he comes?

Are you ready for the Bridegroom

When he comes, when he comes?

Behold, he cometh!  behold, he cometh!

Be robed and ready; for the Bridegroom comes.



Chorus:

Behold the Bridegroom; for he comes, for he comes!

Behold the Bridegroom; for he comes, for he comes.

Behold, he cometh!  behold, he cometh!

Be robed and ready, for the Bridegroom comes.



2.

Have your lamps trimm'd and burning

When he comes, when he comes:

Have your lamps trimm'd and burning 

When he comes, when he comes;

He quickly cometh!  he quickly cometh!

O soul, be ready when the Bridegroom comes.  [Chorus]



3.

We will all go out to meet him

When he comes, when he comes;

We will all go out to meet him

When he comes, when he comes;

He surely cometh!  he surely cometh!

We'll go to meet him when the Bridegroom comes.  [Chorus]



4.

We will chant alleluias

When he comes, when he comes;

We will chant alleluias

When he comes, when he comes;

Lo!  now he cometh!  lo! now he cometh!

Sing alleluia! for the Bridegroom comes.  [Chorus]
