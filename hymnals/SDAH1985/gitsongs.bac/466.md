# 1

Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight,

Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;

In celestial like strains it unceasingly falls

O’er my soul like an infinite calm.



# Refrain

Peace! Peace! wonderful peace,

Coming down from the Father above;

Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray,

In fathomless billows of love.



# 2

What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace,

Buried deep in my inner most soul,

So secure that no power can mine it away,

While the years of eternity roll!



# 3

I believe when I rise to that city of peace,

Where the Author of peace I shall see,

That one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing,

In that heavenly kingdom will be-



# 4

Weary soul, without gladness or comfort or rest,

Passing down the rough pathway of time!

Make the Savior your friend ere the shadows grow dark;

O accept of this peace so sublime.
