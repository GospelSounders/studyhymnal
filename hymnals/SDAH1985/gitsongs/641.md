# 1

God in His love for us lent us this planet,

Gave it a purpose in time and in space:

Small as a spark from the fire of creation,

Cradle of life and the home of our race.



# 2

Thanks be to God for its bounty and beauty,

Life that sustains us in body and mind:

Plenty for all, if we learn how to share it,

Riches undreamed of to fathom and find.



# 3

Long have our human wars ruined its harvest;

Long has earth bowed to the terror of forced;

Long have we wasted what others have need of,

Poisoned the fountain of life at its source.



# 4

Earth is the Lord’s: it is ours to enjoy it,

Ours, as His stewards, to farm and defend.

From its pollution, misuse, and destruction,

Good Lord, deliver us, world without end!
