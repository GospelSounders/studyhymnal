# 1

My faith has found a resting place,

Not in a manmade creed;

I trust the ever living One,

That He for me shall plead.



# Refrain

I need no other evidence,

I need no other plea;

It is enough that Jesus died,

And rose again for me.



# 2

Enough for me that Jesus saves,

This ends my fear and doubt;

A sinful soul, I come to Him,

He will not cast me out.



# 3

My soul is resting on the Word,

The living Word of God,

Salvation in my Savior’s name,

Salvation through His blood.



# 4

My great Physician heals the sick,

The lost He came to save;

For me His precious blood He shed,

For me His life He gave.
