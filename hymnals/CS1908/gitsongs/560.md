# 1

Never be sad or desponding,

Only have faith to believe;

Grace, for the duties before thee,

Ask of thy God and receive.



Chorus:

Never give up, 

Never give up,

Never give up to thy sorrows,

Jesus will bid them depart;

Trust in the Lord,

Trust in the Lord,

Sing when your trials are greatest,

Trust in the Lord and take heart.



# 2

What if thy burdens oppress thee?

What tho' thy life may be drear?

Look, on the side that is brightest,

Pray, and thy path will be clear.  [Chorus]



# 3

Never be sad or desponding,

Lean on the arm of thy Lord;

Dwell in the depths of His mercy,

Thou shalt receive thy reward.  [Chorus]
