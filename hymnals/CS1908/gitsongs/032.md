# 1

We'll build on the Rock, the living rock,

On Jesus, the Rock of Ages;

So shall we abide the fearful shock,

When loud the tempest rages.



Chorus:

We'll build on the Rock,

We'll build on the Rock;

We'll build on the Rock, on the solid Rock,

On Christ, the mighty Rock.



# 2

Some build on the sinking sands of life,

On visions of earthly treasure;

Some build on the waves of sin and strife,

Of fame, and worldly pleasure.  [Chorus]



# 3

O build on the Rock, forever sure,

The firm and the true foundation;

Its hope is the hope which shall endure,

The hope of our salvation.  [Chorus]
