# 1

We gather together to ask the Lord’s blessing;

He chastens and hastens His will to make known.

The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.

Sing praises to His Name; He forgets not His own.



# 2

Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining,

Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;

So from the beginning the fight we were winning;

Thou, Lord, were at our side, all glory be Thine!



# 3

We all do extol Thee, Thou leader triumphant,

And pray that Thou still our defender wilt be.

Let Thy congregation escape tribulation;

Thy name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free!
