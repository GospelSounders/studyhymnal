# 1

Jerusalem, my happy home,

O how I long for thee!

When will my sorrows have an end,

The joys when shall I see?



# 2

The walls are all of precious stone,

Most glorious to behold;

Thy gates are richly set with pearl,

Thy streets are paved with gold.



# 3

Thy garden and thy pleasant walks

My study long have been;

Such dazzling views by human sight

Have never yet been seen.



# 4

Lord, help us by Thy mighty grace,

To keep in view the prize,

Till Thou dost come to take us home

To that blessed paradise.
