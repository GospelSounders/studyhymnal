# 1

Under His wings I am safely abiding;

Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,

Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;

he has redeemed me, and I am His child.



# Refrain

Under His wings, under His wings,

Who from His love can sever?

Under His wings, my soul shall abide,

Safely abide forever.



# 2

Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!

How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!

Often when earth has no balm for my healing,

There I find comfort, and there I am blest.



# 3

Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!

There will I hide till life’s trials are over;

Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;

Resting in Jesus I’m safe evermore.
