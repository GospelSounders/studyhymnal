# 1

Gladly, gladly, toiling for the Master,

Go we forth with willing hands to do

Whatsoe'er to us he hath appointed,

Faithfully our mission we'll pursue.



Refrain:

Toiling for Jesus,

Joyfully we go, joyfully we go

Toiling for Jesus,

In his vineyard here below.



# 2

Joyful, joyful, we will tell the story

Of his love to mortals here below;

Christ, the brightness of the Father's glory,

Freely here his blessing will bestow.  [Refrain]



# 3

Meekly, meekly, following the Master,

Walking faithfully the path he trod;

Leading wand'rers to the dear Redeemer,

Pointing sinners to the Lamb of God.  [Refrain]
