1.

Hark!  that shout of rapture high,

Bursting forth from yonder cloud;

Jesus comes, thro' the sky,

Angels tell their joy aloud,

Angels tell their joy aloud.



2.

Hark!  the trumpet's awful voice

Sounds abroad o'er sea and land;

Let his people now rejoice;

Their redemption is at hand,

Their redemption is at hand.



3.

See, the Lord appears in view;

Heav'n and earth before him fly;

Rise, ye saints, he comes for you;

Rise, to meet him in the sky,

Rise, to meet him in the sky.



4.

Go and dwell with him above,

Where no foe can e'er molest;

Happy in the Saviour's love,

Ever blessing, ever blest,

Ever blessing, ever blest.
