1
Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah!
Pilgrim through this barren land:
I am weak, but thou art mighty;
Hold me with thy pow'rful hand:
Bread of heaven,
Feed me till I want no more.

2
Open now the crystal fountain,
Whence the healing waters flow;
Let the fiery, cloudy pillar,
Lead me all my journey through:
Strong Deliv'rer,
Be thou still my strength and shield.

3
When I tread the verge of Jordan,
Bid my anxious fears subside:
Bear me through the swelling current,
Land me safe on Canaan's side;
Songs of praises
I will ever give to thee.
