# 1

‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,

And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;

If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,



# Refrain

What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

Blessed hour of prayer, Blessed hour of prayer,

What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!



# 2

‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near,

With a tender compassion His children to hear;

When He tells us we may cast at His feet every care,



# 3

‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried

To the Savior who loves them their sorrows confide;

With a sympathizing heart He removes every care;



# 4

‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe,

That the blessings we’re needing we’ll surely receive;

In the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care;
