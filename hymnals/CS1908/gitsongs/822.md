1.

Another year is dawning!

Dear Master, let it be

In working or in waiting,

Another year with thee.



2.

Another year of mercies,

Of faithfulness and grace,

Another year of gladness,

The shining of thy face.



3.

Another year of service,

Of witness for thy love;

Another year of training

For holier work above.
