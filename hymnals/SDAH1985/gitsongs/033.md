# 1

Sing a new song to the Lord,

He to whom wonders belong.

Rejoice in His triumph and tell of His power.

O sing a new song to the Lord.



# 2

Now to the ends of the earth

See His salvation is shown.

And still He remembers His mercy and truth,

Unchanging in love to His own.



# 3

Sing a new song and rejoice.

Publish His praises abroad.

Let voices in chorus with trumpet and horn,

Resound for the joy of the Lord.



# 4

Join with the hills and the sea,

Thunders of praise to prolong.

In judgement and justice

He comes to the earth

O sing a new song to the Lord.
