# 1

"Forbid them not," the Saviour cried,

"But suffer them to come;"

Ah, then maternal tears were dried, 

And unbelief was dumb.



# 2

Lord, we believe, and we obey;

We bring them at thy word;

Be thou our children's strength and stay,

Their portion and reward.



# 3

Let not earth's pleasures draw them down;

Lord, give them strength to rise,

And thro' thy strong, attractive pow'r,

At last to gain the prize.
