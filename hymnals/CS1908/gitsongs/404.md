404 – Bless the Lord


1
Stand up, and bless the Lord,
Ye people of his choice;
Stand up, and bless the Lord your God,
With heart, and soul, and voice.

2
Tho' high above all praise,
Above all blessing high,
Who would not fear his holy name,
And laud and magnify?

3
O for the living flame
From his own altar brought,
To touch our lips, our souls inspire,
And wing to heav'n our thought!

4
God is our strength and song,
And his salvation ours;
Then be his love in Christ proclaimed
With all our ransom'd pow'rs.
