# 1

Let all the world in every corner sing, My God and King!

The heavens are not too high, His praise may thither fly;

The earth is not too low, His praises there may grow.

Let all the world in every corner sing, My God and King!



# 2

Let all the world in every corner sing, My God and King!

The church with psalms must shout, No door can keep them out;

But, above all, the heart must bear the longest part.

Let all the world in every corner sing, My God and King!
