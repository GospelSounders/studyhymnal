# 1

All things are Thine; no gift have we,

Lord of all gifts, to offer Thee;

And hence with grateful hearts today,

Thine own before Thy feet we lay.



# 2

Thy will was in the builder’s thought;

Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought;

Thro’ mortal motive, scheme and plan,

Thy wise, eternal purpose ran.



# 3

No lack Thy perfect fullness knew;

For human needs and longings grew

This house of prayer- this home of rest.

Here may Thy saints be often blessed.



# 4

In weakness and in want we call

On Thee, for whom the heav’ns are small;

Thy glory is Thy children’s good,

Thy joy Thy tender Fatherhood.



# 5

O Father! deign these walls to bless;

Make this the abode of righteousness,

And let these doors a gateway be

To lead us from ourselves to Thee!
