453 â€“ Sing of Jesus Forever


1
Sing of Jesus, sing forever,
Of the love that changes never;
Who or what from Him can sever
Those He makes His own?

2
With His precious blood He bought us;
When we knew Him not, He sought us,
And from all our wand'rings bro't us;
His the praise alone.

3
Thro' the desert drear He leads us,
With the bread of heav'n He feeds us,
And thro' all the journey speeds us
To His glorious throne.
