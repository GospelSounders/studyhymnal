# 1

All my class!  not one forgotten

When before the Throne I kneel;

I would share the loving burden

That my Saviour's heart doth feel.



Refrain:

Ev'ry one, blessed tho't!

Not a single name forgot.

One left out, His joy would dim;

Ev'ry one is dear to Him.



# 2

All my class!  if one be missing

In the glorious gath'ring day,

How shall I account to Jesus?

What shall I with weeping say?  [Refrain]



# 3

Daily would I walk before them,

Sinless in God's holy sight,

Pleading till His Spirit draw them,

Ev'ry one to life and light.  [Refrain]
