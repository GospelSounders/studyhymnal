# 1

There is no love like the love of Jesus,

Never to fail or fall,

Till into the fold of the peace of God,

He has gathered us all.



Chorus:

Jesus' love, precious love,

Boundless and pure and free!

Oh, turn to that love, weary, wand'ring soul,

Jesus pleadeth for thee.



# 2

There is no heart like the heart of Jesus,

Fill'd with a tender love;

No throb of woe that our hearts can know,

But He feeds it above.  [Chorus]



# 3

Oh, hearken now to the voice of Jesus;

Why will you longer roam:

There's peace and rest on His loving breast,

And a glad heav'nly home.  [Chorus]
