# 1

Give, thou, thy youth to God,

With all its budding love;

Send up thy op'ning heart to him,

Fix it on things above.



# 2

He seeks thy heart, my child;

He wants to make thee blest;

Thy soul with his own joy to fill,

To give thee peace and rest.



# 3

Take, thou, the side of God,

In all things great or small,

So shall he ever take thy side,

And bear thee safe thro' all.
