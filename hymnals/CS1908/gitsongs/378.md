# 1

Praise ye the Lord; for it is good

Praise to our God to sing;

For it is pleasant, and to praise 

It is a comely thing.  



Chorus:

Praise the Lord, it is good

Praise to our God to sing:

For it is pleasant, and to praise

It is a comely thing.



# 2

Those that are broken in their heart,

And troubled in their minds,

He healeth, and their painful wounds

He tenderly upbinds.  [Chorus]



# 3

He counts the number of the stars;

He names them ev'ry one:

Our Lord is great, and of great pow'r,

His wisdom search can none.  [Chorus]
