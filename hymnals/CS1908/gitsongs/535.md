# 1

Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,

Anywhere he leads me in this world below;

Anywhere without him, dearest joys would fade,

Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.



Chorus:

Anywhere!  anywhere! 

Fear I cannot know;

Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.



# 2

Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone,

Other friends may fail me, he is still my own;

Tho' his hand may lead me over dreary ways,

Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.  [Chorus]



# 3

Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,

When the gloomy shadows round about me creep,

Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;

Anywhere with Jesus will be home sweet home.  [Chorus]
