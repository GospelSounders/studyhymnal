# 1

How dearly God doth love us,

And this poor world of ours,

To spread blue skies above us,

And deck the earth with flow'rs!

There's not a blossom lowly,

Nor bird that cleaves the air,

But tells, in accents holy,

His kindness and his care.



# 2

He bids the sun to warm us,

And light the path we tread;

At night, lest aught should harm us,

He guards our lowly bed.

He gives our needful clothing,

And sends our daily food;

His love denies us nothing

His wisdom deemeth good.



# 3

The Bible, too, he gave us,

That tells how Jesus came,

Whose word can save and cleanse us

From guilt and sin and shame.

O may God's mercies move us

To serve him with our pow'rs;

For O, how he doth love us,

And this poor world of ours!
