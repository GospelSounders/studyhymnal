# 1

O Jesus, I have promised

to serve thee to the end;

be thou forever near me,

my Master and my friend.

I shall not fear the battle

if thou art by my side,

nor wander from the pathway

if thou wilt be my guide.



# 2

O let me feel thee near me!

The world is ever near;

I see the sights that dazzle,

the tempting sounds I hear;

my foes are ever near me,

around me and within;

but Jesus, draw thou nearer,

and shield my soul from sin.



# 3

O Jesus, thou hast promised

to all who follow thee

that where thou art in glory

there shall thy servant be.

And Jesus, I have promised

to serve thee to the end;

O give me grace to follow,

my Master and my Friend.
