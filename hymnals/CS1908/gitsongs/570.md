# 1

If your hand's on the plow, hold on, hold on;

Tho' the soil may be sterile and hard,

The plowshare will make

The fallow ground break,

And the plowman will have his reward;

Earth's bosom will sparkle with emerald green,

And its grain will be golden king;

The reapers will come, with loud "Harvest Home."

And the gleaners will joyfully sing.



Chorus:

Hold on, hold on, my brother, hold on,

Hold on till the prize is won;

Hold on to the plow,

And weary not now,

For the work is almost done.



# 2

If your heart's in the work, hold on, hold on;

Tho' the way should be gloomy and sad,

A light will appear,

The pathway be clear,

And the heart of the worker be glad;

Heav'n's portals will open, and music resound,

And the mansions of bliss will ring

With praise for the brave, who labor to save,

And the angels will joyfully sing.  [Chorus]
