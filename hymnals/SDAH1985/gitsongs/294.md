# 1

Would you be free from the burden of sin?

There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood;

Would you o’er evil a victory win?

There’s wonderful power in the blood.



# Refrain

There is pow’r, pow’r, wonder working pow’r

In the blood of the Lamb;

There is pow’r, pow’r, wonder working pow’r

In the precious blood of the Lamb.



# 2

Would be free from your passion and pride?

There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood;

Come for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide?

There’s wonderful power in the blood.



# 3

Would you do service for Jesus your King?

There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood;

Would you live daily His praises to sing?

There’s wonderful power in the blood.
