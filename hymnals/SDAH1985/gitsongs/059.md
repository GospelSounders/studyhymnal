# 1

Great our joy as now we gather

Where the Master makes us one:

Where we worship God the Father

Thro’ the Spirit of His Son.

All who search for His church

Find it where His will is done.



# 2

Precious is the tie that binds us

To our God when faith grows cold;

Precious all that now reminds us

He is still our safe stronghold.

Faithful love serves to prove

Here the Shepherd has His fold.



# 3

May we learn from Christ’s example

How to use this house of prayer:

He who loved and cleansed His temple

Wants us all to worship there.

God the Son shuts out none:

In His kingdom all may share.



# 4

Lord, inspire us with Your vision

Of a world which must be won!

Glorious is the church’s mission,

Long endeavoured, scarce begun!

Faithful now – this is how

God’s eternal will is done.
