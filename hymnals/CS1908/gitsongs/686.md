# 1

We lay us calmly down to sleep

When friendly night is come, and leave

To God the rest;

Whether we wake to smile or weep,

Or wake no more on time's fair shore,

He knoweth best, He knoweth best.

O Father, us in safety keep!

We lay us down to sleep.



# 2

As sinks the sun in western skies

When day is done, and twilight dim

Comes silent on,

So fades the world's most luring prize

On eyes that close in deep repose

Till wakes the dawn, Till wakes the dawn.

O Father, us in safety keep!

We lay us down to sleep.



# 3

Why vex our souls with wearing care?

Why shun the grave, for aching head

So cool and low?

Have we found life so passing fair,

So grand to be, so sweet that we

Should dread to go?  Should dread to go?

O Father, us in safety keep!

We lay us down to sleep.



# 4

Some other hand the task can take,

If so it seemeth best, the task

By us begun;

No work for which we need to wake

In joy or grief, for life so brief,

Beneath the sun, Beneath the sun.

O Father, us in safety keep!

We lay us down to sleep.
