# 1

Not what these hands have done,

Can save this guilty soul;

Not what this toiling flesh has borne,

Can make my spirit whole.

Thy work alone, my Lord,

Can ease this weight of sin;

Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,

Can give me peace within.



# 2

Not what I feel or do,

Can give me peace with God;

Not all my prayers, or sighs, or tears,

Can ease my awful load.

Thy love to me, O God, 

Not mine, O Lord, to thee,

Can rid me of this dark unrest,

And set my spirit free.



# 3

No other work save thine,

No meaner blood will do;

No strength, save that which is divine,

Can bear me safely through.

I praise the God of grace,

I trust his love and might.

He calls me his, I call him mine;

My God, my joy, my light.
