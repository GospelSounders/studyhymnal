# 1

The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended;

the darkness falls at Thy behest;

to Thee our morning hymns ascended;

Thy praise shall hallow now our rest.



# 2

We thank Thee that Thy church, unsleeping

while earth rolls onward into light,

through all the world her watch is keeping,

and rests not now by day or night.



# 3

As o’er each continent and island

the dawn leads on another day,

the voice of prayer is never silent,

nor die the strains of praise away.



# 4

So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never,

like earth’s proud empires, pass away.

Thy kingdom stands, and grows forever,

till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.
