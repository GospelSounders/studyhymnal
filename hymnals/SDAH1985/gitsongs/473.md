# 1

Nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!

E’en though it be a cross that raiseth me,

still all my song shall be,

nearer, my God, to thee;

nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!



# 2

Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,

darkness be over me, my rest a stone;

yet in my dreams I’d be

nearer, my God, to thee;

nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!



# 3

There let the way appear, steps unto heaven;

all that thou sendest me, in mercy given;

angels to beckon me

nearer, my God, to thee;

nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!



# 4

Then, with my waking thoughts bright with thy praise,

out of my stony griefs Bethel I’ll raise;

so by my woes to be

nearer, my God, to thee;

nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!



# 5

Or if, on joyful wing cleaving the sky,

sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I fly,

still all my song shall be,

nearer, my God, to thee;

nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
