161 â€“ Come, Holy Spirit


1
Come, Holy Spirit, come,
Let thy bright beams arise,
Dispel the sorrow from our minds,
The darkness from our eyes.

2
Convince us all of sin,
Then lead to Jesus' blood,
And to our wond'ring view reveal
The mercies of our God.

3
'Tis thine to cleanse the heart,
To sanctify the soul,
To pour fresh life in ev'ry part,
And new create the whole.
