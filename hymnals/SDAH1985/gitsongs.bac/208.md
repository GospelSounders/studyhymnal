There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,

There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,

There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,

To gather His loved ones home.

To gather His loved ones home,

To gather His loved ones home.

There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,

To gather His loved ones home.

There’ll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes,

There’ll be a happy tomorrow when Jesus comes,

To gather His loved ones home.

There’ll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,

There’ll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,

To gather His loved ones home.
