# 1

Come, thou Fount of ev'ry blessing,

Tune my heart to sing thy grace;

Streams of mercy, never ceasing, 

Call for songs of loudest praise.

Teach me ever to adore thee,

May I still thy goodness prove,

While the hope of endless glory

Fills my heart with joy and love.



# 2

Here I raise my Ebenezer,

Hither by thy help I've come,

And I hope by thy good pleasure

Safely to arrive at home.

Jesus sought me when a stranger,

Wand'ring from the fold of God;

He to rescue me from danger

Interposed his precious blood.



# 3

O, to grace how great a debtor

Daily I'm constrained to be!

Let thy goodness like a fetter

Bind me closer still to thee.

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,

Prone to leave the God I love,

Here's my heart, O, take and seal it;

Seal it for thy courts above.
