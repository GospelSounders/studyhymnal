# 1

Give!  said the golden sun:

Up rose the mist,

Safe in the silver clouds

Cradled and kissed.

Give!  said the thirsty earth:

Down came the show'r;

Give!  said the raindrops bright,

Up sprang the flow'r.



Chorus:

Living is giving, giving is living;

All things would die if only receiving.

Give!  this is the rule of love by which we live.



# 2

Give!  said the little stream:

Up gushed the spring,

In shady forest nook,

Where robins sing.

Give!  said the river wide:

Brooks hurried down.

Give!  said the ocean tide:

Rivers flowed on.  [Chorus]



# 3

Give!  said the midnight moon:

Swift came the light

Borrowed from far-off sun,

Cheering the night.

Help!  said the "Milky Way:"

Stars heard the call,

Orion, Pleiades, 

Dipper and all.  [Chorus]



# 4

Give!  cried a sinful world:

Down came the Lord,

He who made everything

Just by his word.

Give!  cries the heathen child,

Hungry for love:

Yes!  say our pennies bright,

Lent from above.  [Chorus]
