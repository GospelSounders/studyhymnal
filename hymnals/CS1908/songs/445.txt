445 â€“ He Reigns!


1
He reigns!  the Lord, the Saviour reigns!
Sing to his name in lofty strains,
Let all the saints in songs rejoice,
And in his praise exalt their voice.

2
Deep are his counsels, and unknown.
But grace and truth support his throne;
Tho' gloomy clouds his way surround,
Justice is their eternal ground.

3
In robes of judgment, lo, he comes!
Shakes the wide earth, and cleaves the tombs;
Before him burns devouring fire,
The mountains melt, the seas retire.
