# 1

Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,

Draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art;

Fold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,

Shelter me safe in that haven of rest,

Shelter me safe in that haven of rest.



# 2

Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,

Nought as an offering to Jesus my King-

Only my sinful now contrite heart,

Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,

Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.



# 3

Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine;

Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,

All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;

Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,

Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.



# 4

Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last;

Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;

Through endless ages, ever to be,

Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,

Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee.
