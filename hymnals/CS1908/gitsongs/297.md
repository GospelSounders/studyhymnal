# 1

More love to thee, O Christ!

More love to thee;

Hear thou the pray'r I make

On bended knee.

This is my earnest plea,

More love, O Christ, to thee,

More love to thee!

More love to thee!



# 2

Once earthly joy I craved,

Sought peace and rest;

Now thee alone I seek,

Give what is best.

This all my pray'r shall be,

More love, O Christ, to thee,

More love to thee!

More love to thee!



# 3

Let sorrow do its work,

Send grief or pain;

Sweet are thy messengers,

Sweet their refrain,

When they can sing with me,

More love, O Christ, to thee,

More love to thee!

More love to thee!



# 3

Then shall my latest breath,

Whisper thy praise;

This be the parting cry

My heart shall raise,

This still its pray'r shall be:

More love, O Christ, to thee,

More love to thee!

More love to thee!
