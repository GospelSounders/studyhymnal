# 1

By cool Siloam's shady rill

How fair the lily grows!

How sweet the breath, beneath the hill,

Of Sharon's dewy rose!



# 2

Lo, such the child whose early feet

The paths of peace have trod,

Whose secret heart, with influence sweet,

Is upward drawn to God.



# 3

Dependent on thy bounteous breath,

We seek thy grace alone

In childhood, manhood, age, and death,

To keep us still thine own.
