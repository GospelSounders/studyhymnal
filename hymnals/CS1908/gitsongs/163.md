163 â€“ Light Divine


1
Holy Spirit, light divine,
Shine upon this heart of mine,
Chase the shades of night away,
Turn my darkness into day.

2
Holy Spirit, pow'r divine,
Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
Long has sin, without control,
Held dominion o'er my soul.

3
Holy Spirit, all divine,
Dwell within this heart of mine,
Cast down ev'ry idol throne,
Reign supreme, and reign alone.
