# 1

Songs of praise the angels sang;

Heav'n with alleluias rang,

When Jehovah;s work begun,

When he spake and it was done.

Songs of praise awoke the morn,

When the Prince of Peace was born;

Songs of praise arose, when he 

Captive led captivity.



# 2

Heav'n and earth shall pass away,

Songs of praise shall crown that day;

God will make new heav'n and earth,

Songs of praise shall hail their birth.

And can man alone be dumb

Till that glorious kingdom come?

No; the Church delights to raise

Psalms and hymns and songs of praise.



# 3

Saints below with heart and voice,

Still in songs of praise rejoice;

Learning here, by faith and love,

Songs of praise to sing above.

Hymns of glory, songs of praise,

Father, unto thee we raise;

Jesus, glory unto thee,

With the Spirit ever be.
