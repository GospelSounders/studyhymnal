# 1

Come, praise your Lord and Saviour,

In strains of holy mirth;

Give thanks to him, O children,

Who lived a child on earth.

He loved the little children

And call'd them to his side,

His loving arms embraced them,

And for their sake he died.



# 2

Let boyhood loudly praise thee

With songs of holy joy,

For thou on earth didst sojourn,

A pure and spotless boy.

Make us like thee obedient,

Like thee from evil free;

Like thee in God's own temple;

In happy home like thee.



# 3

In thee all gentlest graces

Are gathered into one.

O give that best adornment

Which Christian maid can wear,

The meek and quiet spirit,

Which shone in thee so fair.



# 4

To thee, with voices blended,

We sing our songs of praise:

Be thou the light and pattern

Of all our childhood days;

And lead us ever onward,

That, while we stay below,

We may like thee, O Jesus,

In grace and wisdom grow.
