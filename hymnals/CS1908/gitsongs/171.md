# 1

One there is above all others,

Well deserves the name of Friend;

His is love beyond a brother's,

Costly, free, and knows no end.



# 2

Which of all our friends, to save us,

Could or would have shed his blood?

But our Jesus died to have us

Reconciled in him to God.



# 3

O for grace our hearts to soften!

Teach us, Lord, to truly love;

We, alas!  forget too often

What a Friend we have above.
