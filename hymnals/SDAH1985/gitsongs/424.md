# 1

For thee, O dear country,

Mine eyes their vigils keep;

For very love beholding

Thy holy name, they weep.



# 2

O one, O only mansion!

O Paradise of joy!

Where tears are ever banish’d

And smiles have no alloy;



# 3

With jasper glow thy burwarks,

Thy streets with emeralds blaze;

The sardius and the topaz

Unite in thee their rays;



# 4

The cross is all thy splendor,

The Crucified thy praise;

His laud and benediction

Thy ransom’d saints shall raise;



# 5

O sweet and blessed country,

The home of God’s elect!

O sweet and blessed country

That eager hearts expect!
