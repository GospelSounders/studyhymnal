# 1

The Lord is coming, let this be

The herald note of jubilee;

And when we meet and when we part

The salutation from the heart.



# Refrain

The Lord is coming, let this be

The herald note of jubilee,

The herald note of jubilee.



# 2

The Lord is coming, sound it forth

From east to west, from south to north;

Speed on! Speed on the tidings glad,

That none who love Him may be sad.



# Refrain

The Lord is coming, let this be

The herald note of jubilee,

The herald note of jubilee.



# 3

The Lord is coming, swift and sure

And all His judgements shall endure,

And none can hope to escape His wrath,

Who walk not in the narrow path.



# Refrain

The Lord is coming, let this be

The herald note of jubilee,

The herald note of jubilee.



# 4

This earth, with her ten thousand wrongs

Will soon be tuned to nobler songs;

Our praise shall then, in realms of light,

With all His universe unite.



# Refrain

The Lord is coming, let this be

The herald note of jubilee,

The herald note of jubilee.
