# 1

Saviour, again to thy dear name we raise

With one accord our parting hymn of praise;

We stand to bless thee ere our worship cease,

Then, lowly kneeling, wait thy word of peace.



# 2

Grant us thy peace upon our homeward way;

With thee began, with thee shall end, the day;

Guard thou the lips from sin, the heart from shame,

That in this house have called upon thy name.



# 3

Grant us thy peace thro'out our earthly life,

Our balm in sorrow, and our stay in strife;

Then when thy voice shall bid our conflict cease,

Call us, O Lord, to thine eternal peace!
