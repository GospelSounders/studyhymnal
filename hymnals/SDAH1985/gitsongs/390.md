# 1

We love Thy Sabbath, Lord,

And worship at Thy will;

Oh may these hours sweet peace afford

And deeper faith instill.



# 2

Thine angels sang for joy

Cration’s work to see;

We too, this day, would raise our hearts

In grateful praise to Thee.



# 3

Praise for Thy wondrous love,

That sealed this sacred day,

A sign that all may understand

We own Thy sovereign sway.



# 4

O great Creator King,

Through Thy redeeming grace,

Renew and sanctify our hearts

That we may see Thy face.



# 5

And with the white-robed throng,

Upon Mount Sion be,

And joyful sing our Sabbath song

Through all eternity.
