422 â€“ All Things Are Thine


1
All things are thine; no gift have we,
Lord of all gifts!  to offer thee;
And hence, with grateful hearts to-day,
Thine own, before thy feet we lay.

2
Thy will was in the builders' tho't;
Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought;
Thro' mortal motive, scheme, and plan,
Thy wise, eternal purpose ran.

3
No lack thy perfect fulness knew;
For human needs and longings grew
This house of prayer this home of rest
Here may thy saints be often blest.

4
O Father!  deign these walls to bless,
Make this th' abode of righteousness,
And let these doors a gateway be
To lead us from ourselves to thee.
