# 1

Take my life, and let it be

Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;

Take my hands and let them move

At the impulse of Thy love.



Chorus:

Wash me in the Saviour's precious blood

Cleanse me in its purifying flood

Lord, I give to Thee, my life and all, to be,

Thine, henceforth eternally.



# 2

Take my feet, and let them be

Swift and beautiful for Thee;

Take my voice and let me sing

Always, only, for my King.  [Chorus]



# 3

Take my lips and let them be

Filled with messages for Thee;

Take my silver and my gold,

Not a mite would I withhold.  [Chorus]



# 4

Take my moments and my days,

Let them flow in endless praise;

Take my intellect, and use,

Ev'ry pow'r as thou shalt choose.  [Chorus]



# 5

Take my will, and make it Thine;

It shall be no longer mine!

Take my heart, it is thine own,

It shall be Thy royal throne.  [Chorus]



# 6

Take my love, my Lord, I pour

At Thy feet its treasure store;

Take myself, and I will be

Ever, only, all for Thee.  [Chorus]
