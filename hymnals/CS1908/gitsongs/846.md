1.

Asleep in Jesus!  blessed sleep

From which none ever wake to weep;

A calm and undisturbed repose,

Unbroken by the last of foes.



2.

Asleep in Jesus!  O how sweet

To be for such a slumber meet!

With holy confidence to rest

In hope of being ever blest.



3.

Asleep in Jesus!  Peaceful rest,

Whose waking is supremely blest;

No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour

That manifests the Saviour's pow'r.



4.

Asleep in Jesus!  Soon to rise,

When the last trump shall read the skies;

Then burst the fetters of the tomb,

And wake in full, immortal bloom.
