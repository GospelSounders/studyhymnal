# 1

In the hour of trial,

Father, strengthen me;

Lest by base denial,

I depart from thee.

When thou see'st me waver,

With a touch recall,

Nor from thy dear favor,

Suffer me to fall.



# 2

With forbidden pleasures

Would this vain world charm,

Or its sordid treasures 

Spread to work me harm;

By thy love sustaining,

Father keep thy child;

All my foes restraining,

And my passions wild.



# 3

Should thy mercy send me

Sorrow, care, and woe;

Or should pain attend me

On my path below:

Grant that I may never

Fail thy hand to see;

Grant that I may ever

Cast my care on thee.  Amen.
