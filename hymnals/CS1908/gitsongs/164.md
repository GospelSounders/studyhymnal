# 1

Come, gracious Spirit, heavenly Dove,

With light and comfort from above;

Be thou our Guardian, thou our Guide;

O'er all our thoughts and steps preside.



# 2

To us the light of truth display,

And make us know and choose thy way;

Plant holy fear in ev'ry heart,

That we from God may ne'er depart.



# 3

Lead us to holiness, the road

That we must take to dwell with God:

Lead us to Christ, the living way,

Nor let us from his precepts stray.



# 4

Lead us to God, our final rest,

To be with Him forever blest;

Lead us to heav'n, its bliss to share

Fulness of joy forever there!
