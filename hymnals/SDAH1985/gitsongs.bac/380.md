# 1

Welcome, day of sweet repose!

Blessed be thy sacred hours!

We would trust the One who knows

All our weak and failing powers.



# 2

Welcome, day in Eden born!

Holy rest for sinless man!

Like the dawning of fair morn

Come thy hours to us again.



# 3

Welcome, day blessed by our Lord!

Toil shall cease and anxious care.

Day commanded by His word,

Day for song and praise and prayer.



# 4

Welcome, day our Savior kept!

Keeping, wrought our righteousness,

Day God bids us ne’er forget,

Day of days His name to bless.
