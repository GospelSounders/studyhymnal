# 1

Saints of God, the dawn is bright'ning,

Tokens of the coming Lord;

O'er the earth the fields are whit'ning,

Louder rings the Master's word:

Pray for reapers, Pray for reapers,

In the harvest of the Lord.



# 2

Feebly now they toil in sadness,

Weeping o'er the waste around,

Slowly gath'ring grains of gladness,

While their echoing cries resound:

Pray that reapers, Pray that reapers,

In God's harvest may abound.



# 3

Now, O Lord, ful fill thy pleasure,

Breathe upon thy chosen band,

And with pentecostal measure,

Send forth reapers in our land;

Faithful reapers, Faithful reapers,

Gath'ring sheaves for thy right hand.



# 4

Soon shall end the time of weeping,

Soon the reaping time will come,

Heav'n and earth together keeping

God's eternal harvest home;

Saints and angels, Saints and angels,

Shout the world's great harvest home.
