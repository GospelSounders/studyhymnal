# 1

Children singing, sweet bells ringing!

Welcome, welcome, happy day!

Pray'rs of thousands now are winging

Up to heav'n their silent way.



Chorus:

Welcome, welcome, joyous welcome;

Teachers, scholars, welcome here!



# 2

'Tis an hour of happy meeting,

We have met for praise and pray'r;

But the hour is short and fleeting;

This is why we're early here.  [Chorus]



# 3

We'll not keep our teachers waiting,

While we tarry by the way,

Nor disturb the school reciting,

'Tis the holy Sabbath day.  [Chorus]
