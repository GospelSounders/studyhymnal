# 1

Take time to be holy,

Speak oft with thy Lord;

Abide in Him always,

And feed on His Word;

Make friends of God's children,

Help those who are weak,

Forgetting in nothing

His blessing to seek.



# 2

Take time to be holy,

The world rushes on;

Spend much time in secret

With Jesus alone;

By looking to Jesus,

Like Him thou shalt be;

Thy friends in thy conduct

His likeness shall see.



# 3

Take time to be holy,

Let Him be thy Guide,

And run not before Him,

Whatever betide;

In joy or in sorrow,

Still follow thy Lord,

And, looking to Jesus,

Still trust in His Word.



# 4

Take time to be holy,

Be calm in thy soul,

Each tho't and each motive

Beneath His control;

Thus led by His Spirit

To fountains of love,

Thou soon shalt be fitted

For service above.
