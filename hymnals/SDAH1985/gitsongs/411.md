# 1

The Son of God proclaim,

The Lord of time and space;

The God who bade the light break forth

Now shines in Jesus’ face.



# 2

Behold His out stretched hands,

Though all was in His power

He took the towel and basin then,

And serves us in this hour.



# 3

He, God’s creative word,

The church’s Lord and head,

Here bids us gather as His friends,

And share His wine and bread.



# 4

The Lord of life and death

With wondering praise we sing;

We break the bread at His command,

And name Him God and King.



# 5

We take this cup in hope:

For He, who gladly bore

The shameful cross, is ris’n again,

And reigns forevermore.
