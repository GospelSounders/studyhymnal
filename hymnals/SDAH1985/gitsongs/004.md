# 1

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;

To his feet thy tribute bring;

Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,

Who like thee His praise should sing?

Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!

Praise the everlasting King.



# 2

Praise him for his grace and favor

To our fathers in distress;

Praise him still the same forever,

Slow to chide and swift to bless:

Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!

Glorious in His faithfulness.



# 3

Tenderly He shields and spares us;

Well our feeble frame he knows;

In his hands He gently bears us,

Rescues us from all our foes.

Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!

Widely yet his mercy flows.



# 4

Angels, help us to adore him;

Ye behold him face to face;

Sun and moon, bow down before him,

Dwellers all in time and space.

Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!

Praise with us the God of grace.
