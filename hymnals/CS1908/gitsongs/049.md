# 1

When the Judge shall weigh our motives,

For eternal gain or loss,

Shall we stand as gold before him?

Or as vile and worthless dross?



Refrain:

Weigh'd in the balance of the Lord,

Weigh'd, weigh'd, and wanting;

Weigh'd by the standard of his word,

Weigh'd, weigh'd, and wanting.



# 2

Shall we hear the glad words spoken:

"Faithful servant," and "Well done,"

Or the dread and awful sentence,

"Thou are wanting," sinful one?  [Refrain]



# 3

Shall we heed the Spirit's pleading,

While for mercy we may call,

Or delay till God's handwriting

Seals the final doom of all?  [Refrain]
