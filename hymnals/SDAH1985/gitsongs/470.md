# 1

There’s sunshine in my soul today,

More glorious and bright

Than glows in any earthly sky,

For Jesus is my light.



# Refrain

O there’s sunshine, blessed sunshine,

When the peaceful, happy moments roll

When Jesus shows His smiling face

There is sunshine in the soul.



# 2

There’s music in my soul today,

A carol to my King,

And Jesus, listening, can hear

The songs I cannot sing.



# 3

There’s springtime in my soul today,

For when the Lord is near,

The dove of peace sings in my heart,

The flowers of grace appear.



# 4

Theres gladness in my soul today,

And hope, and praise, and love,

For blessings which He gives me now,

For joys “laid up” above.
