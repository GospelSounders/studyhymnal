153 â€“ Rest Found


1
O where shall rest be found
Rest for the weary soul?
'Twere vain the ocean's depths to sound,
Or pierce to either pole.

2
Beyond this vale of tears
There is a life above,
Unmeasured by the flight of years;
And all that life is love.

3
Thro' Christ, the Life, the Way,
May we that life obtain;
And thro' the merits of his blood,
That endless glory gain.
