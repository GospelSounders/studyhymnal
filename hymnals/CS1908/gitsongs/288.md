288 – Blessed Be the Name


1
O for a thousand tongues to sing:
Blessed be the name of the Lord!
The glories of my God and King,
Blessed be the name of the Lord!

Chorus:
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

2
Jesus, the name that charms our fears,
Blessed be the name of the Lord!
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
Blessed be the name of the Lord!  [Chorus]

3
He breaks the pow'r of cancelled sin,
Blessed be the name of the Lord!
His blood can make the foulest clean,
Blessed be the name of the Lord!  [Chorus]
