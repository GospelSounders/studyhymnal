# 1

My soul in sad exile was out on life's sea,

So burdened with sin, and distressed,

Till I heard a sweet voice saying, "Make me your choice;"

And I entered the "Haven of Rest!"



Chorus:

I've anchored my soul in the "Haven of Rest,"

I sail the wide seas no more;

The tempest may sweep o'er the wild, stormy deep,

In Jesus I'm safe evermore.



# 2

I yield myself to his tender embrace,

And faith taking hold of his Word,

My fetters fell off, and I anchored my soul:

The Haven of Rest is my Lord.  [Chorus]



# 3

The song of my soul, since the Lord made me whole,

Has been the OLD STORY so blest,

Of Jesus, who'll save whosoever will have

A home in the "Haven of Rest!"  [Chorus]



# 4

How precious the tho't that we all may recline,

Like John the beloved and blest,

On Jesus' strong arm, where no tempest can harm,

Secure in the "Haven of Rest!"  [Chorus]



# 5

O come to the Saviour!  he patiently waits

To save by his power divine;

Come, anchor your soul in the "Haven of Rest,"

And say, "my Beloved is mine."  [Chorus]
