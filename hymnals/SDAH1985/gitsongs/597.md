# 1

Ye servants of the Lord,

Each in his office wait,

Observant of His heavenly Word,

And watchful at His gate.



# 2

Let all your lamps be bright,

And trim the golden flame,

Gird up your loins as in His sight,

His coming thus proclaim.



# 3

Watch, ’tis your Lord’s command,

And while we speak He’s near;

Mark the first signal of His hand,

And ready all appear.



# 4

O happy servant, he,

In such a posture found!

He shall His Lord with rapture see,

And be with honor crowned.
