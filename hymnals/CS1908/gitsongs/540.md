# 1

Walk in the light the Lord has given

To guide thy steps aright;

His Holy Spirit, sent from heav'n,

Can cheer the darkest night.



Chorus:

Walk in the light,

Walk in the light

Walk in the light,

Walk in the light, the light of God.



# 2

Walk in the light of gospel truth

That shines from God's own Word,

A light to guide in early youth

The faithful of the Lord.  [Chorus]



# 3

Walk in the light; tho' shadows dark

Should fall across thy way,

Darkness will flee before the light

Of God's eternal day.  [Chorus]



# 4

Walk in the light, and thou shall know

The love of God to thee;

The fellowship, so sweet below,

In heav'n will sweeter be.  [Chorus]
