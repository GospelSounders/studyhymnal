# 1

Far and near the fields are teeming

With the sheaves of ripened grain;

Far and near their gold is gleaming

O'er the sunny slope and plain.



Chorus:

Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!

Hear us, Lord, to thee we cry;

Send them now the sheaves to gather,

Ere the harvest time pass by.



# 2

Send them forth with morn's first beaming,

Send them in the noontide's glare;

When the sun's last rays are streaming,

Bid them gather ev'rywhere.  [Chorus]



# 3

O thou whom thy Lord is sending,

Gather now the sheaves of gold,

Heav'nward then at evening wending

Thou shalt come with joy untold.  [Chorus]
