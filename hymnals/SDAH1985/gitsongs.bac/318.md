# 1

Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;

I want Thee forever to live in my soul;

Break down every idol, cast out every foe;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.



# Refrain

Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.



# 2

Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,

And help me to make a complete sacrifice;

I give up myself, and whatever I know;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.



# 3

Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;

I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet,

By faith, for my cleansing; I see Thy blood flow;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.



# 4

Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;

Come now, and within me a new heart create;

To those who have sought Thee,

Thou never said’st No;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
