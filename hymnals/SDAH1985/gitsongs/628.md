# 1

As Jacob with travel was weary one day,

At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;

He saw in a vision a ladder so high

That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.



# Refrain

Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,

And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,

And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.



# 2

Come let us ascend! All may climb it who will;

For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:

And remember each step that by faith we passo’er,

Some prophet or martyr has trod it before.



# 3

And when we arrive at the haven of rest

We shall hear the glad words, “Come up hither, ye blest,

Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss.”

O who would not climb such a ladder as this?
