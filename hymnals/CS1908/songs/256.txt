256 â€“ Our King


1
Our sweetest songs of gladness,
On this delightful day,
We bring to praise the Saviour,
Who is the Life, the Way.

Chorus:
We sing, we sing
The praises of our King,
We sing, we sing
The glory of our King.

2
He lov'd the little children,
When he was here below,
And tho' he's up in heaven,
He loves us yet we know.  [Chorus]

3
We love to sing his praises
And hear the stories told,
Of him when he was dwelling
In Galilee of old.  [Chorus]

4
O Saviour, blessed Saviour,
We kneel, before thy throne,
And ask that thou wilt help us
To live for thee alone.  [Chorus]
