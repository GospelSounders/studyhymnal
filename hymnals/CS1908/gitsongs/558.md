# 1

Lifetime is working time, spend no idle days;

Jesus is calling thee on the harvest ways;

Working with a willing hand, sing a song of praise;

Work, ever work for Jesus!



Chorus:

Swiftly the hours of labor fly,

Freighted with love let each pass by!

There is joy in labor for the struggling neighbor,

Work, ever work for Jesus!



# 2

Lifetime is working time, learn where duty lies;

Grasp ev'ry passing day as a precious prize;

Glad to help the sorrowing, glad to sympathize;

Work, ever work for Jesus!  [Chorus]



# 3

Lifetime is working time, do thy honest part;

Tho' in discouragements, bear a cheerful heart;

Trusting Jesus as thy friend, ne'er from Him depart.  

Work, ever work for Jesus!  [Chorus]
