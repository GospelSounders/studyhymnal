# 1

For the fruits of His creation, thanks be to God;

For the gifts to every nation, thanks be to God;

For the plowing, sowing, reaping,

Silent growth while men are sleeping,

Future needs in earth’s safe keeping, thanks be to God!



# 2

In the just reward of labor, God’s will is done;

In the hop we give our neighbor, God’s will is done;

In our worldwide take of caring

For the hungry and despairing,

In the harvests men are sharing, God’s will is done.



# 3

For the harvests of His Spirit, thanks be to God;

For the good all men inherit, thanks be to God;

For the wonders that astound us,

For the truths that still confound us,

Most of all, that love has found us, thanks be to God!
