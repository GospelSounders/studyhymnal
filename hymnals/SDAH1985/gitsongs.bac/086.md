# 1

O Lord my God

When I in awesome wonder

Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made

I see the stars

I hear the rolling thunder

Thy power throughout the universe displayed



# Refrain

Then sings my soul

My Saviour God to Thee

How great Thou art

How great Thou art

Then sings my soul

My Saviour God to Thee

How great Thou art

How great Thou art



# 2

When through the woods

And forest glades I wander

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees

When I look down

From lofty mountain grandeur

And see the brook and feel the gentle breeze



# 3

And when I think

That God His Son not sparing

Sent Him to die I scarce can take it in

That on the Cross

My burden gladly bearing

He bled and died to take away my sin.



# 4

When Christ shall come

With shouts of acclamation

And take me home

What joy shall fill my heart

Then I shall bow

In humble adoration

And then proclaim

“My God, how great Thou art!”
