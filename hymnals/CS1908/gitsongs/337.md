# 1

God's free mercy streameth

Over all the world,

And His banner gleameth,

By His church unfurled;

Broad and deep and glorious,

As the heav'n above,

Shines in might victorious

His eternal love.



# 2

Summer suns are glowing

Over land and sea;

Happy light is flowing,

Bountiful and free;

Evrything rejoices 

In the mellow rays;

Earth's ten thousand voices

Swell the psalm of praise.



# 3

Lord, upon our blindness,

Thy pure radiance pour;

For Thy loving kindness

We would love Thee more;

And when clouds are drifting

Dark across the sky,

Then, the vail uplifting,

Father, be Thou nigh.



# 4

We will never doubt Thee,

Tho' Thou vail Thy light;

Life is dark without Thee,

Death with Thee is bright;

Light of light, shine o'er us

On our pilgrim way,

Go Thou still before us

To the endless day.
