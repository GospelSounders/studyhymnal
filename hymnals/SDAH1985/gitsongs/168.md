# 1

And have the bright immensities

Received our risen Lord,

Where light years frame the Pleiades

And point Orion’s sword?

Do flaming suns His footsteps trace

Thro’corridors sublime,

The Lord of inter stellar space

And conqueror of time?



# 2

The heav’n that hides Him from our sight

Knows neither near nor far;

A little candle sheds its light

As surely as a star.

And where His loving people meet

To share the gift divine,

There stands He with unhurrying feet;

There heav’nly splendors shine.
