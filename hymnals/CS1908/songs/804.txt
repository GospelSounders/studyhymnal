804 â€“ Thou Hast Left Us


1.
Sister, thou wast mild and lovely,
Gentle as the summer breeze;
Pleasant as the air of evening
When it floats among the trees.

2.
Dearest sister, thou hast left us!
Here thy loss we deeply feel;
But 'tis God that hath berelf us,
He can all our sorrows heal.

3.
Yet again we hope to meet thee,
When this mortal life is fled;
Then, in heav'n, with joy to greet thee,
Where no farewell tear is shed.
