# 1

Lord Jesus, once You spoke to men

Upon the mountain and the plain,

O help us listen now as then

And wonder at Your words again.



# 2

We all have secret fears to face,

Our minds and motives to amend.

We seek Your truth,

We need your grace,

Our living Lord and present friend.



# 3

The gospel speaks; and we receive

Your light, Your love,

Your own command.

O help us live what we believe,

In daily word of heart and hand.
