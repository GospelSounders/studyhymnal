393 â€“ Thy Mercies


1
When all thy mercies, O my God!
My rising soul surveys,
Transported with the view, 
I'm lost in wonder, love, and praise.

2
Unnumbered comforts to my soul
Thy tender care bestowed,
Before my infant heart discerned
From whom those blessings flowed.

3
Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
My daily thanks employ;
Nor is the least a cheerful heart,
That tastes these gifts with joy.

4
O, how can words with equal warmth
The gratitude declare
That glows within my raptured heart?
But thou canst read it there.

5
Through all eternity, to thee
A joyful song I'll raise:
But O, eternity's too short
To utter all thy praise!
