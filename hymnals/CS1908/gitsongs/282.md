# 1

I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,

And it told Thy love to me;

But I long to rise in the arms of faith,

And be closer drawn to Thee.



Refrain:

Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

To the cross where Thou hast died;

Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

To Thy precious, bleeding side.



# 2

Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,

By the pow'r of grace divine;

May my soul look up with a steadfast hope

And my will be lost in Thine.  [Refrain]



# 3

O the pure delight of a single hour

That before Thy throne I spend,

When I kneel in pray'r, and with Thee, my God,

I commune as friend with friend!  [Refrain]



# 4

There are depths of love that I cannot know

Till I cross the narrow sea;

There are heights of joy that I may not reach

Till I rest in peace with Thee.  [Refrain]
