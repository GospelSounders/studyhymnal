# 1

The wonders of redeeming love

Our highest thoughts exceed;

The Son of God comes from above,

For sinful man to bleed.



# 2

He gives himself, his life, his all,

A sinless sacrifice,

For man he drains the cup of gall,

For man the Maker dies.



# 3

And now before his Father's face

His precious blood he pleads;

For those who seek the throne of grace

His love still intercedes.
