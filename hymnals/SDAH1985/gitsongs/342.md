# 1

Is this a day of new beginnings,

Time to remember and move on,

Time too believe what love is bringing,

Laying to rest the pain that’s gone?



# 2

How can the seasons of a planet

Mindlessly spinning round its sun

With just a human name and number

Say that some new thing has begun?



# 3

Yet through the life and death of Jesus

Love’s mighty Spirit, now as then,

Can make for us a world of difference

As faith and hope are born again.



# 4

Then let us, with the Spirit’s daring,

Step from the past and leave behind

Its disappointment, guilt, and grieving,

Seeking new paths, and sure to find.



# 5

Christ is alive, and goes before us

To show and share what love can do.

This is a day of new beginnings;

Our God is making all things new.
