# 1

Jesus loves me!  this I know,

For the Bible tells me so;

Little ones to Him belong,

They are weak, but He is strong.



Chorus:

Yes, Jesus loves me,

Yes, Jesus loves me;

Yes, Jesus loves me,

The Bible tells me so.



# 2

Jesus loves me!  He who died,

Heaven's gate to open wide;

He will wash away my sin.

Let His little child come in.  [Chorus]



# 3

Jesus loves me!  loves me still,

When I'm sad or weak and ill;

From His shining throne on high,

Comes to watch me where I lie.  [Chorus]



# 4

Jesus loves me; He will stay,

Close beside me all the way,

If I love Him, by and by

He will take me home on high.  [Chorus]
