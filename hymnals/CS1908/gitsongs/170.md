# 1

Take my heart, O Father, take it!

Make and keep it all Thine own;

Let Thy Spirit melt and break it,

This proud heart of sin and stone.



# 2

Father, make it pure and lowly,

Fond of peace and far from strife;

Turning from the paths unholy,

Of this vain and sinful life.



# 3

Ever let Thy race surround me,

Strengthen me with pow'r divine;

By Thy cords of love that bound me,

Make me to be wholly Thine.



# 4

May the blood of Jesus heal me,

And my sins be all forgiv'n;

Holy Spirit, take and seal me, 

Guide me in the path to heav'n.
