# 1

I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!

He loved me ere I knew Him;

He drew me with the cords of love,

And thus He bound me to Him.

And ’round my heart still closely twine

Those ties which nought can sever,

For I am His, and He is mine,

Forever and forever.



# 2

I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!

He bled, He died to save me;

And not alone the gift of life,

But His own self He gave me.

Nought that I have my own I call,

I hold it for the Giver;

My heart, my strength, my life my all,

Are His, and His forever.



# 3

I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!

All power to Him is given;

To guard me on my upward course,

And bring me safe to heaven.

The eternal glories gleam afar,

To nerve my faint endeavor;

So now to watch, to work, to war,

And then to rest forever.



# 4

I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!

So kind, and true, and tender,

So wise a counselor and guide,

So mighty a defender.

From Him, who loveth me so well,

What power my soul can sever?

Shall life or death, or earth, or hell?

No; I am His forever.
