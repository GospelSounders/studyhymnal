# 1

Fight the good fight with all thy might;

Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right;

Lay hold on life and it shall be

Thy joy and crown eternally.



# 2

Run the straight race through God’s good grace;

Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face.

Life with its path before us lies;

Christ is the way, and Christ the prize.



# 3

Cast care aside, lean on thy guide,

His boundless mercy will provide;

Trust, and the trusting soul shall prove

Christ is its life, and Christ its love.



# 4

Faint not, nor fear, His arms are near;

He changeth not, and thou art dear.

Only believe, and thou shalt see

That Christ is all in all to thee.
