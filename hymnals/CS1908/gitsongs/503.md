# 1

What a fellowship, what a joy divine,

Leaning on the everlasting arms;

What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,

Leaning on the everlasting arms.



Refrain:

Leaning, leaning,

Safe and secure from all alarms,

Leaning, leaning,

Leaning on the everlasting arms.



# 2

O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,

Leaning on the everlasting arms;

O how bright the path grows from day to day

Leaning on the everlasting arms.  [Refrain]



# 3

What have I to dread, what have I to fear,

Leaning on the everlasting arms?

I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,

Leaning on the everlasting arms.  [Refrain]
