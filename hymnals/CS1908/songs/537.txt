537 â€“ "Even Unto the End"


1"Go
ye into all the world,
And preach the gospel to ev'ry creature,"
Let my banner be unfurled,
With pen, and song, and the living teacher.

Chorus:
"Even unto the end,
Even unto the end;"
"Lo, I am with you alway,
Even unto the end."

2
Millions bless'd with gospel light,
Yet need the gladness of sins forgiven;
Millions, cursed with heathen night,
Yet long to know of the Way to heaven.  [Chorus]

3
Stand not idle all the day,
Because no man hath declared thy wages;
Work on, love demands no pay,
'Tis all set down in the heav'nly pages.  [Chorus]

4
All things on the altar lay,
Let Calvry's cross be thy only glory;
Cast all selfish fear away,
Begin just now telling love's sweet story.  [Chorus]
