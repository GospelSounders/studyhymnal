# 1

Awake, awake to love and work!

The lark is in the sky;

The fields are wet with diamond dew;

The worlds awake to cry

Their blessings on the Lord of life,

As He goes meekly by.



# 2

Come, let thy voice be one with theirs,

Shout with their shout of praise;

See how the giant sun soars up,

Great lord of years and days!

So let the love of Jesus come

And set thy soul ablaze.



# 3

To give and give, and give again,

What God hath given thee;

To spend thyself nor count the cost;

To serve right gloriously

The God who gave all worlds that are,

And all that are to be.
