410 â€“ Can We Forget?


1
Jesus, thy love can we forget,
And never bring to mind
The grace that paid our hopeless debt,
And bade us pardon find?

2
Shall we thy life of grief forget,
Thy fasting and thy pray'r,
Thy locks with mountain vapors wet,
To save us from despair?

3
Gethsemane can we forget
Thy struggling agony
When night lay dark on Olivet,
And none to watch with thee?

4
Our sorrows and our sins were laid
On Thee, alone on thee;
Thy precious blood our ransom paid
Thine all the glory be!
