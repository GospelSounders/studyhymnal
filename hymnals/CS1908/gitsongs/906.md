1.

A few more years shall roll,

A few more seasons come,

And we shall meet the loved who now

Are sleeping in the tomb:



Chorus:

Then, O my Lord, prepare

My soul for that great day;

O, wash me in thy precious blood,

And take my sins away.



2.

A few more storms shall beat

On this wild, rocky shore,

And we shall be where tempests cease,

And surges swell no more:  [Chorus]



3.

A few more struggles here,

A few more partings sore,

A few more toils, a few more tears,

And we shall weep no more:  [Chorus]



4.

'Tis but a little while,

And He shall come again,

Who died that we might live, who lives

That we may with him reign:  [Chorus]
