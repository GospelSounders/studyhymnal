# 1

"Eternity!  where?"  It floats in the air;

Amid clamor or silence it ever is there!

The question so solemn "Eternity!  where?"  

The question so solemn "Eternity!  where?"



# 2

"Eternity!  where?"  Oh!  Eternity!  where?

With redeemed ones in glory?  or lost in despair?

'Tis one or the other  "Eternity!  where?"

'Tis one or the other "Eternity!  where?"



# 3

"Eternity!  where?"  Oh!  how can you share

The world's giddy pleasures, or heedlessly dare

Do aught till you settle  "Eternity!  where?"

Do aught till you settle  "Eternity!  where?"



# 4

"Eternity!  where?"  Oh!  friend, have a care;

Soon God will no longer His judgment forbear;

This day may decide your "Eternity!  where?"

This day may decide your "Eternity!  where?"



# 5

"Eternity!  where?"  Oh!  Eternity!  where?

Friend, sleep not, nor take in the world any share,

Till you answer this question "Eternity!  where?"

Till you answer this question "Eternity!  where?"
