444 – High in the Heavens


1
High in the heav'ns, eternal God,
Thy goodness in full glory shines;
Thy truth shall break thro' ev'ry cloud
That vails thy just and wise designs.

2
Forever firm thy justice stands,
As mountains their foundations keep;
Wise as the wonders of thy hands,
Thy judgments are a mighty deep.

3
O God, how excellent thy grace,
Whence all our hope and comfort spring!
The sons of Adam, in distress,
Fly to the shadow of thy wing.
