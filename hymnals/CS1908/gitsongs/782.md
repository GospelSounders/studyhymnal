782 â€“ God, Our Refuge


1.
God is the refuge of his saints
When storms of sharp distress invade
Ere we can offer our complaints,
Behold him present with his aid.

2.
Loud may the troubled ocean roar;
In sacred peace our souls abide;
While ev'ry nation, ev'ry shore,
Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide.

3.
Zion enjoys her Monarch's love,
Secure against a threat'ning hour;
Nor can her firm foundation move,
Built on his truth, and armed with pow'r.
