# 1

In heavenly love abiding, No change my heart shall fear;

And safe is such confiding, For nothing changes here.

The storm may roar without me, My heart may low be laid;

But God is round about me, And can I be dismayed?



# 2

Wherever He may guide me, No want shall turn me back;

My Shepherd is besided me, And nothing can I lack.

His wisdom ever waketh, His sight is never dim;

He knows the way He taketh, And I will walk with Him.



# 3

Green pastures are before me, Which yet I have not seen;

Bright skies will soon be o’er me, Where darkest clouds have been.

My hope I cannot measure, My path to life is free;

My Savior has my teasure, And He will walk with me.
