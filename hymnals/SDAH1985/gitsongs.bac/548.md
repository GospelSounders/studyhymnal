# 1

Now praise the hidden God of love

In whom we all must live and move,

Who shepherds us, at every stage

Thro’ youth, maturity, and age.



# 2

Who challenged us, when were young

To storm the citadels of wrong;

In care for others taught us how

God’s true community must grow.



# 3

Who bids us never lose our zest,

Tho’ age is urging us to rest,

But proves to us that we have still

A work to do, a place to fill.



# 4

Then talk no more of wasted time,

But Godward look, and upward climb,

Content to sleep, when day is done,

And rise refreshed, and travel on.
