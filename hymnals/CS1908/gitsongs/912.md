1.

Who are these like stars appearing,

These, before God's throne who stand?

Each a golden crown is wearing,

Who are all this glorious band?

Alleluia!  hark, they sing,

Praising loud their heav'nly King.



2.

These are they who have contended

For their Saviour's honor long,

Wrestling on till life was ended,

Foll'wing not the sinful throng:

Alleluia!  hark, they sing,

Praising loud their heav'nly King.



3.

These are they whose hearts were riven,

Sore with woe and anguish tried,

Who in pray'r full oft have striven

With the God they glorified:  

Alleluia!  hark, they sing, 

Praising loud their heav'nly King.
