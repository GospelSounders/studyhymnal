# 1

Courage, brother!  do not stumble,

Tho' thy path be dark as night;

There's a star to guide the humble:

Trust in God, and do the right.

Let the road be rough and dreary,

And its end far out of sight,

Foot it bravely; strong or weary,

Trust in God, trust in God,

Trust in God and do the right.



# 2

Perish policy and cunning,

Perish all that fears the light.

Whether losing, whether winning,

Trust in God, and do the right.

Trust no party, sect, or faction;

Trust no leaders in the fight;

But in ev'ry word or action 

Trust in God, trust in God,

Trust in God and do the right.



# 3

Some will hate thee, some will love thee,

Some will flatter, some will slight;

Cease from man, and look above thee:

Trust in God, and do the right.

Take His word for safest guiding,

Inward peace, and inward might,

Star upon our path abiding

Trust in God, trust in God,

Trust in God and do the right.
