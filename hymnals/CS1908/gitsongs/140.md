# 1

Go to dark Gethsemane,

Ye that feel the tempter's power;

Your Redeemer's conflict see,

Watch with him one bitter hour;

Turn not from his griefs away,

Learn of Jesus how to pray.



# 2

Follow to the judgment-hall;

View the Lord of life arraigned;

See the wormwood and the gall;

See the pangs his soul sustained;

Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;

Learn of him to bear the cross.



# 3

Calvary's mournful mountain climb;

There, adoring at his feet,

Mark that miracle of time,

God's own sacrifice complete:

"It is finished!" hear him cry;

Learn of Jesus how to die.
