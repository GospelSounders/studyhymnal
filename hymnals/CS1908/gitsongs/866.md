1.

With friends on earth we meet in gladness,

While swift the moments fly,

Yet ever comes the tho't of sadness,

That we must say "Good-by."



Chorus:

We'll never say good-by in heav'n,

We'll never say good-by,

In that fair land of joy and song

We'll never say good-by.



2.

How joyful is the hope that lingers,

When loved ones say "Farewell,"

That we, when all earth's toils are ended,

With them shall ever dwell.  [Chorus]



3.

No parting words shall e'er be spoken

In yonder home so fair;

But songs of joy, and peace, and gladness,

We'll sing forever there.  [Chorus]
