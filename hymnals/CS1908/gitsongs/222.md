# 1

Safe in the arms of Jesus, 

Safe on his gentle breast,

Here by his love o'ershaded, 

Sweetly my soul doth rest.

Hark!  'tis the voice of angels,

Borne in a song to me,

Over the fields of glory,

Over the jasper sea.



Refrain:

Safe in the arms of Jesus,

Safe on his gentle breast,

Here by his love o'ershaded,

Sweetly my soul doth rest.



# 2

Safe in the arms of Jesus,

Safe from corroding care;

Safe from the world's temptations,

Sin cannot harm me there.

Free from the blight of sorrow,

Free from my doubts and fears;

Only a few more trials,

Only a few more tears.  [Refrain]



# 3

Jesus, my heart's dear refuge,

Jesus, has died for me;

Firm on the Rock of Ages,

Ever my trust shall be.

Here let me wait with patience,

Wait till the night is o'er;

Wait till I see the morning

Break on the golden shore.  [Refrain]
