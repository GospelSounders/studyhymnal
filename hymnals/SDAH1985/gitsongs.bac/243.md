# 1

King of glory, King of peace, I will love Thee;

And that love may never cease, I will move Thee.

Thou hast granted my request, Thou hast heard me;

Thou didst note my working breast, Thou hast spared me.



# 2

Wherefore with my utmost art I will sing Thee,

And the cream of all my heart I will bring Thee.

Though my sins against me cried, Thou didst clear me;

And alone, when they replied, Thou didst hear me.



# 3

Seven whole days, not one in seven, I will praise Thee;

In my heart, though not in heav’n I can raise Thee.

Small it is, in this poor sort to enroll Thee:

Ev’n eternity’s too short to extol Thee.
