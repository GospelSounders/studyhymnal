# 1

We should be like gardens,

Bright and sweet with flow'rs,

Bless'd with heaven's sunshine,

Cheer'd by gentle show'rs;

Violets are the kind words,

Roses, deeds of love,

Fragrant pinks and pansies,

Tho'ts of God above.



Chorus:

Beautiful flow'rs, beautiful flow'rs,

Bright with morning dew;

Beautiful flow'rs, beautiful flow'rs,

We would be like you.



# 2

Not a frown of anger,

Not a shade of care,

Not one look of sadness

Do the blossoms wear;

They are always trusting,

This is how they grow

Beautiful and fragrant,

In a world of woe.  [Chorus]



# 3

Selfish tho'ts and wishes,

Unkind words and deeds,

Are like cruel brambles,

Thistles, thorns, and weeds;

Kind tho'ts are the sweetest,

Loving words the best,

Yielding hope and comfort,

Joy, and peace, and rest.  [Chorus]



# 4

Jesus has a garden,

Fill'd with children sweet;

We would be among them,

Bowing at his feet,

Drinking in life's waters,

Growing by his grace,

Like the flowers, looking

Up into his face.  [Chorus]
