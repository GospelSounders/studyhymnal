# 1

I’m but a stranger here,

Heav’n is my home;

Earth is a desert drear,

Heav’n is my home.

Danger and sorrow stand

Round me on every hand;

Heav’n is my fatherland,

Heav’n is my home.



# 2

What though the tempest rage,

Heav’n is my home;

Short is my pilgrimage,

Heav’n is my home;

And time’s wild wintry blast

Soon shall be over past;

I shall reach home at last,

Heav’n is my home.



# 3

There at my Savior’s side

Heav’n is my home;

I shall be glorified,

Heav’n is my home;

There are the good and blest,

Those I love most and best;

And there I, too, shall rest,

Heav’n is my home.
