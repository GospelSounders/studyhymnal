# 1

Father, help Your people in this world to build

Something of Your kingdom and to do Your will,

Lead us to discover partnership in love;

Bless our ways of sharing and our pride remove.



# 2

Lord of desk and altar, bind our lives in one,

That in work and worship love may set the tone.

Give us grace to listen, clarity of speech;

Make us truly thankful for the gifts of each.



# 3

Holy is the setting of each room and yard,

Lecture hall and kitchen, office, shop, and ward.

Holy is the rhythm of our working hours;

Hallow then our purpose, energy, and pow’rs.



# 4

Strengthen, Lord, for service hand and heart and brain;

Help us good relations daily to maintain.

Let the living presence of the servant Christ

Heighten our devotion, make our life a feast.
