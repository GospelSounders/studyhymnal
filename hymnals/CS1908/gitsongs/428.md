# 1

The spring-tide hour brings leaf and flow'r,

With songs of life and love,

And many a lay to cheer the day

In many a leafy grove.



# 2

Dews fall apace, the dews of grace,

On souls made sad by sin;

And love divine delights to shine

Upon the waste within.



# 3

As year by year the flow'rs appear,

And birds their praises sing,

Why not, my heart, bear well thy part,

In nature's joyous spring?



# 4

Lord, let thy love, fresh from above,

Soft as the south wind blow,

Till my heart bloom in sweet perfume,

And fragrant spices flow.
