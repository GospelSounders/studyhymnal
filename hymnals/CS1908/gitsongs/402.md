402 – Thy Word Is Like a Garden


1
Thy Word is like a garden, Lord,
With flowers bright and fair;
And ev'ry one who seeks may pluck
And weave a garland rare.

2
Thy Word is like a deep, deep  mine;
And jewels rich and rare 
Are hidden in its mighty depths
For ev'ry searcher there.

3
O may I love Thy precious Word,
May I explore the mine,
May I the fragrant flowers glean,
Thy graces all divine.
