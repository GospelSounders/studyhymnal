# 1

I love Thee, I love Thee, I love Thee,my Lord;

I love Thee, my Savior, I love Thee, my God.

I love Thee, I love Thee, and that Thou dost know;

But how much I love Thee my actions will show.



# 2

I’m happy, I’m happy, O, wondrous account!

My joys are immortal, I stand on the mount!

I gaze on my treasure and long to be there,

With Jesus and angels, and kindred so dear.



# 3

O Jesus, my Savior, with Thee I am blest,

My life and salvation, my joy and my rest:

Thy name be my theme, and Thy love be my song;

Thy grace shall inspire both my heart and my tongue.



# 4

O, who’s like my Savior? He’s Salem’s bright King;

He smiles, and He loves me, and helps me to sing.

I’ll praise Him, I’ll praise Him, with notes loud and clear

While rivers of pleasure my spirit do cheer.
