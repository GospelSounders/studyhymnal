# 1

As pants the hart for cooling streams

When heated in the chase,

So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,

And Thy refreshing grace.



# 2

For Thee, my God, the living God,

My thirsty soul doth pine:

O when shall I behold Thy face,

Thou Majesty divine?



# 3

Why restless, why cast down, my soul?

Hope still, and thou shalt sing

The praise of Him who is thy God,

Thy health’s eternal spring.



# 4

To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,

The God whom we adore,

Be glory, as it was, is now,

And shall be evermore.
