# 1

What can wash away my sin?

Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

What can make me pure within?

Nothing but the blood of Jesus.



Refrain:

Oh, precious is the flow

That makes me white as snow;

No other fount I know,

Nothing but the blood of Jesus.



# 2

For my cleansing this I see

Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

For my pardon this my plea

Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]



# 3

Nothing can for sin atone

Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

Naught of good that I have done

Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]



# 4

This is all my hope and peace

Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

This is all my righteousness

Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]



# 5

Glory!  glory!  thus I sing

Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

All my praise for this I bring

Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]
