# 1

The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?

By day and by night His presence is near;

He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;

This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.



# Refrain

The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;

By day and by night He leads me along;

The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;

By day and by night He leads me along.



# 2

The Lord is my light; though clods may arise,

Faith, stronger than sight, looks up to the skies

Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign:

Then how can I ever in darkness remain?



# 3

The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength;

I know in His might I’ll conquer at length;

My weakness in mercy He covers with power,

And, walking by faith, He upholds me each hour.



# 4

The lord is my light, my all and in all;

There is in His sight no darkness at all;

He is my Redeemer, my Savior and King;

With saints and with angels His praises I sing.
