# 1

Ring the bells of heaven!  there is joy today,

For a soul, returning from the wild;

See!  the Father meets him out upon the way,

Welcoming His weary, wand'ring child.



Chorus:

Glory!  glory!  how the angels sing;

Glory!  glory!  how the loud harps ring;

'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,

Pealing forth the anthem of the free.



# 2

Ring the bells of heaven!  there is joy today,

For the wanderer now is reconciled;

Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way,

And is born a new a ransomed child.  [Chorus]



# 3

Ring the bells of heaven!  spread the feast today,

Angels, swell the glad triumphant strain.

Tell the joyful tidings!  bear it far away!

For a precious soul is born again.  [Chorus]
