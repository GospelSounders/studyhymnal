# 1

O where shall rest be found

Rest for the weary soul?

'Twere vain the ocean's depths to sound,

Or pierce to either pole.



# 2

Beyond this vale of tears

There is a life above,

Unmeasured by the flight of years;

And all that life is love.



# 3

Thro' Christ, the Life, the Way,

May we that life obtain;

And thro' the merits of his blood,

That endless glory gain.
