1
Tossed upon life's raging billow.
Sweet it is, O Lord, to know
Thou didst press a sailor's pillow.
Thou canst feel a sailor's woe;
Never slumb'ring, never sleeping.
Tho' the night be dark and drear,
Thou the faithful watch art keeping;
"All is well," thy constant cheer.

2
Thou my heart the hope will cherish,
While to thee I lift mine eye,
Thou wilt save me o'er I perish,
Thou wilt hear the sailor's cry;
And the mast and sail be riven,
Soon life's voyage will be o'er;
Safely moored in heav'n's wide haven,
Storm and temptest vex no more.
