# 1

Come, let us sing the song of songs,

The angels first began the strain,

The homage which to Christ belongs;

"Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain!"



# 2

Slain to redeem us by his blood,

To cleanse from ev'ry sinful stain,

And make us kings and priests to God;

"Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain!"



# 3

Long as we live, and when we die,

And while in heav'n with him we reign,

This song our song of songs shall be;

"Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain!"
