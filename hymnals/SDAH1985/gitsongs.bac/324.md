# 1

Just as I am, Thine own to be,

Friend of the young, who lovest me,

To consecrate myself to Thee,

O Jesus Christ, I come.



# 2

In the glad morning of my day,

My life to give, my vows to pay,

With no reserve and no delay,

With all my heart I come.



# 3

I would live ever in the light,

I would work ever for the right;

I would serve Thee with all my might;

Therefore, to Thee I come.



# 4

Just as I am, young, strong, and free,

To be the best that I can be

For truth, and righteousness, and Thee,

Lord of my life, I come.
