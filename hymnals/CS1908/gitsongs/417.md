417 â€“ Forbid Them Not


1
"Forbid them not," the Saviour cried,
"But suffer them to come;"
Ah, then maternal tears were dried, 
And unbelief was dumb.

2
Lord, we believe, and we obey;
We bring them at thy word;
Be thou our children's strength and stay,
Their portion and reward.

3
Let not earth's pleasures draw them down;
Lord, give them strength to rise,
And thro' thy strong, attractive pow'r,
At last to gain the prize.
