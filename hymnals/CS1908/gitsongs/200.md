# 1

I can hear my Saviour calling,

In the tend'rest accents calling;

On my ear these words are falling,

Come and follow, daily follow me."



Chorus:

I will take my cross and follow.

My dear Saviour I will follow;

Where he leads me I will follow,

I'll go with him, with all the way.



# 2

Tho' the way be dark and dreary,

Tho' my feet be worn and weary,

Yet my heart keeps bright and cheery

As I follow, follow all the way.  [Chorus]



# 3

Jesus, ever go before me,

Shining heaven's sunlight o'er me,

And when weak, by grace restore me

As I follow, follow all the way.  [Chorus]



# 4

Thro' the valley safely lead me,

Heav'nly manna daily feed me;

Ev'ry hour, dear Lord, I need thee

As I follow, follow all the way.  [Chorus]



# 5

In thy heart's affection, hold me,

In thy arms of love enfold me,

And with thine own grace uphold me,

As I follow, follow all the way.  [Chorus]
