# 1

Lord of all being, throned afar,

Thy glory flames from sun and star;

Center and soul of every sphere

Yet to each loving heart how near!

Yet to each loving heart how near!



# 2

Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray

Shed on our path the glow of day;

Star of our hope, Thy softened light

Cheers the long watches of the night,

Cheers the long watches of the night.



# 3

Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn;

Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn;

Our rainbow arch, Thy mercy’s sign;

All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine,

All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.



# 4

Lord of all life, below, above

Whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,

Before Thy ever-blazing throne

We ask no luster of our own,

We ask no luster of our own.



# 5

Grant us Thy truth to make us free

And kindling hearts that burn for Thee;

Till all Thy living altars claim

One holy light, one heavenly flame!

One holy light, one heavenly flame.
