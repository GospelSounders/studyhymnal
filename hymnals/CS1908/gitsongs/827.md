1.

O blest are they who oft have said, 

"I thirst for righteousness;

I hunger for the heav'nly Bread

With anguish and distress."



2.

They of My fulness shall be fed,

For which they hungered sore;

And by the Living Waters led,

Their souls shall thirst no more.



3.

Because I am the Truth, the Life,

All fulness dwells in me;

They know no want, no sin, no strife,

Thro' all eternity.



4.

How blessed, then, to share a part

With those that hunger here;

To have the panting, thirsty heart,

And shed the bitter tear!
