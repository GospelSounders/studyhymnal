152 â€“ Not Blood of Beasts


1
Not all the blood of beasts
On Jewish altars slain,
Could give the guilty conscience peace,
Or wash away the stain.

2
But Christ, the heav'nly Lamb,
Takes all our sins away;
A sacrifice of nobler name
And rich blood than they.

3
My faith would lay her hand
On that dear head of thine,
While like a penitent I stand,
And there confess my sin.
