1.

Watch, ye saints, with eyelids waking;

Lo!  the powers of heav'n are shaking;

Keep your lamps all trimm'd and burning,

Ready for your Lord's returning.



Refrain:

Lo!  he comes, lo!  Jesus comes;

Lo!  he comes, he comes, all glorious!

Jesus comes to reign victorious,

Lo!  he, comes, yes, Jesus comes.



2.

Lo!  the promise of your Saviour,

Pardoned sin and purchased favor,

Blood-wash'd robes and crowns of glory;

Haste to tell redemption's story.  [Refrain]



3.

Kingdoms at their base are crumbling,

Hark!  his chariot wheels are rumbling;

Tell, O tell of grace abounding,

Whilst the seventh trump is sounding.  [Refrain]



4.

Nations wane, tho' proud and stately;

Christ his kingdom hasteneth greatly;

Earth her latest pangs is summing;

Shout, ye saints, your Lord is coming.  [Refrain]



5.

Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading;

Now for you he's interceding;

Haste, ere grace and time diminished

Shall proclaim the mystery finished.  [Refrain]
