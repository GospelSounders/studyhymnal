1.

When I shall awake in that fair morn of morns,

After whose dawning never night returns,

And with whose bright glory day eternal burns,

I shall be satisfied then.



Refrain:

I shall be satisfied then,

I shall be satisfied then.

When I shall awake, in that fair morn of morns,

I shall be satisfied then.



2.

And when I shall see His glory face to face,

Hear his glad welcome, feel his fond embrace,

And feast on the fulness of his heav'nly grace,

I shall be satisfied then.  [Refrain]



3.

And when I shall meet the friends that I have loved,

Clasp to my bosom dear ones long removed,

And witness how faithful Christ to me that proved,

I shall be satisfied then.  [Refrain]



4.

O soon I shall gaze upon the face of Him,

Pierced to redeem me from the curse of sin,

And praise him forever with the glad new hymn;

I shall be satisfied then.  [Refrain]
