# 1

Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,

Wake the hour of jubilee;

Nations waiting for the message

Onward, Christian, victory!

Hell's proud cohorts almost vanquished,

Vanquished for eternity.



# 2

Hear the cry of distant nations,

Hear the call to you and me:

Come and lift the fallen sinner,

Help from Satan's wrath to flee.

Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,

Wake the hour of jubilee.



# 3

Then with strength and courage ever,

Gird the gospel armor on;

Faithfully we'll press the battle

Till the victory is won.

Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,

Wake the hour of jubilee.



# 4

Onward, onward, ever onward,

Be our watchword in the fray,

Bear the banner bravely forward,

Let there be no more delay.

Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,

Wake the hour of jubilee.
