# 1

What shall I do with Jesus?

He stands before me now,

Wearing the robe of purple,

And thorns upon His brow.



Refrain:

This is the question now;

What shall the answer be?

Shall I crucify King Jesus,

And set Barabbas free?



# 2

Shall I release the robber,

The carnal man of pride?

Sin or a sinless Saviour?--

O which shall be denied?



Refrain:

This is the question now;

What shall the answer be?

Shall I crucify King Jesus,

And set Barabbas free?



# 3

Solemn and awful question!  

How still the balance stands!

Mercy a moment lingers,

It trembles in her hands.



Refrain:

This is the question now;

What shall the answer be?

Shall I crucify King Jesus,

And set Barabbas free?



# 4

Self on the seat of judgment,

Dare you the world deny?

Louder and louder calling,

"Away!"  and "Crucify!"



Refrain:

This is the question now;

What shall the answer be?

Shall I crucify King Jesus,

And set Barabbas free?



# 5

Not to the sinner only,

The question comes with pow'r;

Hear it, ye halting Christians,

In ev'ry trial hour.



Refrain:

This is the question now;

What shall the answer be?

I will crucify Barabbas,

And set King Jesus free.
