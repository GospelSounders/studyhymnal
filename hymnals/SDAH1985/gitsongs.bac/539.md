# 1

I will early seek the Savior,

I will learn of Him each day;

I will follow in His footsteps,

I will walk the narrow way.



# Refrain

For He loves me, yes, He loves me,

Jesus loves me, this I know.

Jesus loves me, died to save me,

This is why I love Him so.



# 2

I will hasten where He bids me,

I am not too young to go

In the pathway where He leadeth,

Not too young His will to know.



# 3

He is standing at the doorway

Of escape from every sin;

I will knock, for He has promised,

He will hear and let me in.
