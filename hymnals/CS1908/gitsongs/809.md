1.

What is the chaff, the word of man,

When set against the wheat?

Can it a dying soul sustain

Like that immortal meat?



2.

Thy word, O God, with heav'nly bread

Thy children doth supply;

And those who by thy word are fed,

Their souls shall never die.



3.

'Tis like a field where hidden lies

The pearl of price unknown,

And he indeed is truly wise

Who makes this pearl his own.
