# 1

Eternal Father!  strong to save,

Whose arm doth bind the restless wave,

Who bidst the mighty ocean deep

Its own appointed limits keep:

O hear us when we cry to thee

For those in peril on the sea!



# 2

O Saviour!  whose almighty word

The winds and waves submissive heard,

Who walkedst on the foaming deep,

And calm amidst its rage didst sleep:

O hear us when, etc.



# 3

O Sacred Spirit!  who didst brood

Upon the chaos dark and rude,

Who bad'st its angry tumult cease,

And gavest light and life and peace:

O hear us when, etc.
