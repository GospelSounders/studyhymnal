# 1

Come, every soul by sin oppressed,

There’s mercy with the Lord,

And He will surely give you rest,

By trusting in His word.



# Refrain

Only trust Him, only trust Him,

Only trust Him now;

He will save you, He will save you,

He will save you now.



# 2

For Jesus shed his precious blood

Rich blessings to bestow;

Plunge now into the crimson flood

That washes white as snow.



# 3

Yes, Jesus is the truth, the way,

That leads you into rest;

Believe in Him without delay,

And you are fully blest.



# 4

Come, then, and join this holy band,

And on to glory go,

To dwell in that celestial land,

Where joys immortal flow.
