838 â€“ Spirit of Truth


1.
Spirit of truth and might,
'Tis Thou alone canst teach
Both young and old to use aright
The wondrous power of speech.

2.
The tongue can no man tame;
It is a deadly ill;
And hence Thy gracious aid we claim,
To bend it to Thy will.

3.
May all our words below
Be prompted by Thy love,
Till we are called to hear and know
The speech of saints above.
