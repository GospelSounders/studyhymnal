# 1

My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine,

For thee all the follies of sin I resign;

My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art thou;

If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.



# 2

I love thee, because thou hast first loved me,

And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;

I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow;

If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.



# 3

I'll love thee in life, and I'll love thee in death;

I'll praise thee as long as thou lendest me breath,

And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,

If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.



# 4

In mansions of glory and endless delight,

I'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright,

And sing with the glittering crown on my brow,

If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
