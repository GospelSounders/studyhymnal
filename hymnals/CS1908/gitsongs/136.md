# 1

The last call of mercy now lingers for thee;

O sinner, receive it; to Jesus now flee!

He often has called thee, but thou hast refused;

His offered salvation and love are abused.



# 2

O slight not the warning now offered at last,

Till summer is ended and harvest is past;

Till mercy, long slighted, has left thy heart's door,

And pardon, sweet pardon is offered no more.



# 3

While Jesus is calling, O turn not away;

For swiftly approaches the dread Judgment day:

The Spirit invites you, O why will you roam?

Come now to life's waters, ye thirsty ones, come.
