# 1

This rite our blest Redeemer gave

To all in him believing;

He bids us seek this hallowed grave,

To his example cleaving.



Chorus:

I'll follow now my glorious Lord,

Whate'er the ties I sever;

He saves my soul, he's left his word

To guide me now and ever.



# 2

For me the cross and shame to bear,

Dear Saviour, thou wast willing;

Nor would I shrink thy yoke to wear,

All righteousness fulfilling.  [Chorus]



# 3

Jesus to thee we yield our all;

In thy kind arms enfold us;

Our hearts are fixed, no fears appall,

Thy gracious power shall hold us.  [Chorus]
