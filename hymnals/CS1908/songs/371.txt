371 â€“ God, in the Gospel


1
God, in the gospel of His Son,
Makes His eternal counsels known;
Where love in all its glory shines,
And truth is drawn in fairest lines.

2
Here sinners, of an humble frame,
May taste His grace, and learn His name;
May read in characters of blood,
The wisdom, pow'r and grace of God.

3
The pris'ner here may break his chains,
The weary rest from all his pains,
The captive feel his bondage cease,
The mourner find the way of peace.

4
Oh, grant us grace, Almighty Lord,
To read aright Thy holy word,
Its truth with meekness to receive,
And by its holy precepts live.
