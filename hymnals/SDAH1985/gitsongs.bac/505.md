# 1

I need the prayers of those I love,

While trav’ling o’er life’s rugged way,

That I may true and faithful be,

And live for Jesus every day.



# Refrain

I want my friends to pray for me,

To bear my tempted soul above,

And intercede with God for me;

I need the prayers of those I love.



# 2

I need the prayers of those I love,

To help me in each trying hour,

To bear my tempted sould to Him,

That He may keep me by His pow’r.



# Refrain

I want my friends to pray for me,

To hold me up on wing of faith,

That I may walk the narrow way,

Kept by our Father’s glorious grace.
