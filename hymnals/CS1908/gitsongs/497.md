# 1

Moment by moment, hour by hour,

Constantly trusting His keeping pow'r;

Day by day and week by week,

Only His praise my tongue shall speak.



Refrain:

Moment by moment, Helper is He,

Moment by monument dwelling in me;

Gently subduing powers of sin,

Wonderful Saviour is Christ within.



# 2

Why for the body anxious thot'? 

Knowing He careth, sweet is my lot;

Mine is the asking, His the store,

Moment by moment, o'er and o'er.  [Refrain]



# 3

Why should the spirit doubting weep?

What I've committed, surely He'll keep;

Mine is the trusting, His the pow'r,

Moment by moment, hour by hour.  [Refrain]



# 4

Why for the resting sing or sigh,

Selfishly seeking mansions on high?

Earth needeth more of holy love,

Than all the universe above.  [Refrain]
