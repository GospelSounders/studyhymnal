# 1

When Christ was lifted from the earth His arms stretched out above

Through every culture, every birth, to draw an answering love.



# 2

Still east and west His love extends and always, near or far,

He calls and claims us as His friends and loves us as we are.



# 3

Where generation, class, or race divides us to our shame,

He sees not labels but a face, a person and a name.



# 4

Thus freely loved, tho’ fully known, may I in Christ be free

To welcome and accept His own as Christ accepted me.
