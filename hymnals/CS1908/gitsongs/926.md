1.

Thy kingdom come.  Thus day by day

We lift our hands to God and pray;

But who has ever duly weighed

The meaning of the words he said?

The meaning of the words he said?



2.

Thy kingdom come.  O day of joy,

When praise shall every tongue employ;

When hate and strife and war shall cease,

And man with man shall be at peace.

And man with man shall be at peace.



3.

Jesus shall reign on Zion's hill,

And all the earth with glory fill;

His word shall Paradise restore,

And sin and death afflict no more.

And sin and death afflict no more.
