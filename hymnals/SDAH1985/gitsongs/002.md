# 1

All creatures of our God and King

Lift up your voice and with us sing,

Alleluia! Alleluia!

O burning sun with golden beam

And silver moon with softer gleam!



# Refrain

O praise Him! O praise Him!

Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!



# 2

O rushing wind and breezes soft,

O clouds that ride the winds aloft,

O praise Him! Alleluia!

O rising morn, in praise rejoice,

O lights of evening, find a voice!



# 3

O flowing waters, pure and clear,

Make music for your Lord to hear,

O praise Him! Alleluia!

O fire so masterful and bright,

Providing us with warmth and light.



# 4

Let all things their Creator bless,

And worship Him in humbleness,

O praise Him! Alleluia!

Oh, praise the Father, praise the Son,

And praise the Spirit, three in One!
