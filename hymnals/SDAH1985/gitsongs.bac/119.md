# 1

Angels from the realms of glory,

Wing your flight o`er all the earth;

Ye, who sang creation`s story,

Now proclaim Messiah`s birth;

Come and worship, Come and worship,

Worship Christ, the newborn King.



# 2

Shepherds, in the field abiding,

Watching o`er your flocks by night,

God with man is now residing;

Yonder shines the Infant Light;

Come and worship, Come and worship,

Worship Christ, the newborn King.



# 3

Sages, leave your contemplations,

Brighter visions beam afar;

Seek the great Desire of nations;

Ye have seen His natal star;

Come and worship, Come and worship,

Worship Christ, the newborn King.



# 4

Saints, before the altar bending,

Watching long in hope and fear,

Suddenly the Lord, descending,

In His temple shall appear;

Come and worship, Come and worship,

Worship Christ, the newborn King.
