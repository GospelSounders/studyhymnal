# 1

As with gladness men of old

Did the guiding star behold;

As with joy they hailed its light,

Leading onward, beaming bright;

So, most gracious Lord, may we

Evermore be led to Thee.



# 2

As with joyful steps they sped

To that lowly manger bed,

There to bend the knee before

Him whom heav'n and earth adore;

So may we with willing feet

Ever seek the mercy-seat.



# 3

As they offered gifts most rare

At that manger rude and bare;

So may we with holy joy,

Pure, and free from sin's alloy,

All our costliest treasures bring,

Christ, to Thee, our heav'nly King.



# 4

Holy Jesus, ev'ry day

Keep us in the narrow way;

And, when earthly things are past,

Bring our ransomed souls at last

Where they need no star to guide,

Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
