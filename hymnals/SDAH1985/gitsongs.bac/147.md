# 1

Christ upon the mountain peak

Stands alone in glory blazing;

Let us, if we dare to speak,

With the saints and angels praise Him:



# Refrain

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.



# 2

Trembling at His feet we saw

Moses and Elijah speaking;

All the prophets and the law

Shout thro’ them their joyful greeting:



# Refrain

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.



# 3

Swift the cloud of glory came,

God proclaiming in the thunder

Jesus as His Son by name;

Nations cry aloud in wonder!



# Refrain

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.



# 4

This is God’s beloved Son:

Law and prophets fade before Him;

First and last, the only One,

Let creation now adore Him.



# Refrain

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
