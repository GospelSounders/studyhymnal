280 â€“ Welcome Hymn


1
Welcome!  thrice welcome!
Ye loyal host of God,
Welcome!  thrice welcome!
From near and from abroad;
Tho' changing years pass swiftly by,
Our cause is still the same,
And thus we gladly greet you in
Our Master's conq'ring Name.

Chorus:
Welcome!  thrice welcome 
to homes and hearts and love;
Welcome!  thrice welcome!
And blessings from above.

2
Welcome!  thrice welcome!
Believers in the Lord;
Welcome!  thrice welcome!
Upholders of His word;
We meet our Saviour's name to praise,
To learn what He requires,
And by His Spirit's help resolve
To follow His desires.  [Chorus]

3
Welcome!  thrice welcome!
Be steadfast in the right,
Welcome!  thrice welcome!
Till faith is lost in sight;
And when our battles all are won
We'll join the blessed throng,
Then God will welcome us and we
Will hear heav'ns welcome song.  [Chorus]
