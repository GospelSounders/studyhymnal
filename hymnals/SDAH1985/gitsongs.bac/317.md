# 1

King of my life, I crown Thee now,

Thine shall the glory be;

Lest I forget Thy thorn crowned brow,

Lead me to Calvary.



# Refrain

Lest I forget Gethsemane,

Lest I forget Thine agony;

Lest I forget Thy love for me,

Lead me to Calvary.



# 2

Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,

Tenderly mourned and wept;

Angels in robes of light arrayed

Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.



# 3

Let me like Mary, through the gloom,

Come with a gift to Thee;

Show to me now the empty tomb,

Lead me to Calvary.



# 4

May I be willing, Lord, to bear

Daily my cross for Thee;

Even Thy cup of grief to share,

Thou hast borne all for me.
