1.

I love the sacred book of God,

No other can its place supply;

It points me to the saints' abode,

And bids me from destruction fly.



2.

Sweet book!  in thee my eyes discern

The image of my absent Lord;

From thy instructive page I learn

The joys his presence will afford.



3.

But while I'm here, thou shalt supply 

His place, and tell me of his love; 

I'll read with faith's discerning eye,

And thus partake of joys above.
