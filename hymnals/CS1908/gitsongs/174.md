174 â€“ Even Me


1
Lord, I hear of show'rs of blessing
Thou art scatt'ring full and free;
Show'rs the thirsty soul refreshing;
Let some drops now fall on me;

Refrain:
Even me, even me,
Let some drops now fall on me.

2
Pass me not, O gracious Father!
Sinful though my heart may be;
Thou might'st leave me, but the rather
Let thy mercy rest on me.  [Refrain]

3
Have I long in sin been sleeping?
Long been slighting, grieving thee?
Has the world my heart been keeping?
O forgive and rescue me!  [Refrain]

4
Pass me not, O holy Spirit!
Thou canst make the blind to see;
Testify of Jesus' merit,
Speak the word of peace to me.  [Refrain]
