# 1

Father, we come to thee,

No other help have we,

Thou wilt our refuge be,

On thee we call;

Earth is but dark and drear

Without thy presence near;

Be thou our comfort here,

Father of all.



Chorus:

Father, we come to thee,

Turn not away;

Helpless we come to thee,

Hear while we pray.



# 2

Save from our many foes,

Save from our earthly woes,

Be thou our soul's repose

In time of need;

Fearful are we and weak,

To us sweet courage speak;

Thy mighty arm we seek

For strength indeed.  [Chorus]



# 3

Give us by grace divine,

Seal us forever thine,

Our wayward feet incline

From sin to flee.

O guide us we implore,

'Till weary life is o'er,

And on a brighter shore 

We dwell with thee.  [Chorus]
