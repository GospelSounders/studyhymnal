# 1

Are you Christ's light bearer?

Of his joy a sharer?

Is this world fairer

For your cheering ray?

Is your beacon lighted,

Guiding souls benighted

To the land of perfect day?



Chorus:

O brother!  is your lamp trimm'd and burning?

Is the world made brighter by its cheering ray?

Are you wailing, yearning 

For your Lord's returning?

Are you watching day by day?



# 2

Is your heart warm, glowing,

With his love o'er flowing,

And his goodness showing

More and more each day?

Are you pressing onward

With his faithful vanguard,

In the safe and narrow way?  [Chorus]



# 3

Keep your altars burning,

Wait your Lord's returning, 

While your heart's deep yearning

Draws him ever near;

With his radiance splendid

Shall your light be blended

When his glory shall appear.  [Chorus]
