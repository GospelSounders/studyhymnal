1.

The coming King is at the door,

Who once the cross for sinners bore;

But now the righteous ones alone

He comes to gather home.



Chorus:

At the door, at the door,

At the door, yes, even at the door,

He is coming, he is coming,

He is even at the door.



2.

The signs that show his coming near,

Are fast fulfilling year by year,

And soon we'll hail the glorious dawn

Of heaven's eternal morn.  [Chorus]



3.

Look not on earth for strife to cease,

Look not below for joy and peace,

Until the Saviour comes again

To banish death and sin.  [Chorus]



4.

Then in the glorious earth made new

We'll dwell the countless ages thro';

This mortal shall immortal be,

And time, eternity.  [Chorus]
