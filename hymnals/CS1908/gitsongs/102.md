# 1

I was once far away from the Saviour,

And as vile as a sinner could be;

I wondered if Christ, the Redeemer,

Could save a poor sinner like me.



# 2

I wandered on in the darkness,

Not a ray of light could I see,

And the tho't filled my heart with sadness,

There's no help for a sinner like me.



# 3

And then in that dark, lonely hour,

A voice sweetly whispered to me,

Saying Christ, the Redeemer, has power

To save a poor sinner like me.



# 4

I listened, and lo!  'twas the Savior

Who was speaking so kindly to me;

I cried, I'm the chief of sinners,

Oh, save a poor sinner like me.



# 5

I then fully trusted in Jesus,

And, oh, what a joy came to me!

My heart was filled with his praises,

For saving a sinner like me.



# 6

No longer in darkness I'm walking,

For the light is now shining on me,

And now unto others I'm telling

How he saved a poor sinner like me.



# 7

And when life's journey is over,

And I the dear Saviour shall see,

I'll praise him for ever and ever,

For saving a sinner like me.
