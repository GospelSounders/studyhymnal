751 â€“ Ye Christian Heralds!


1.
Ye Christian heralds!  go, proclaim
Salvation thro' Immanuel's name;
To distant climes the tidings bear,
And plant the Rose of Sharon there.

2.
He'll shield you with a wall of fire,
With flaming zeal your breast inspire,
Bid raging winds their fury cease,
And hush the tempest into peace.

3.
And when our labors all are o'er,
Then we shall meet to part no more,
There with the blood-bought throng to fall
And crown our Jesus Lord of all.
