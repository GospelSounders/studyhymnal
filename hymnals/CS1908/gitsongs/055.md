# 1

Hear the words our Saviour hath spoken,

Words of life, unfailing and true;

Careless one, prayerless one, hear and remember,

Jesus says, "Blessed are they that do."



Chorus:

Blessed are they that do his commandments,

Blessed are they, blessed are they;

Blessed are they that do his commandments,

Blessed, blessed, blessed are they.



# 2

All in vain we hear his commandments,

All in vain his promises, too;

Hearing them, fearing them, never can save us,

Blessed, O blessed are they that do.  [Chorus]



# 3

They with joy may enter the city,

Free from sin, from sorrow and strife,

Sanctified, glorified, now and forever,

They may have right to the tree of life.  [Chorus]
