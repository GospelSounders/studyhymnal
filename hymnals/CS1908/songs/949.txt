949 â€“ No Tears


1.
No tears in yonder home;
Sorrow can never come;
Joy echoes thro' the dome;
Love rules the endless years,
No tears, No tears in yonder home.

2.
No pain in yonder home;
Sickness has sealed her room;
Health in immortal bloom
Fills all the wide domain:
No pain, No pain in yonder home.

3.
No death in yonder home;
No parting hour of gloom;
Death lies dead in the tomb,
Whence rose the dust of Faith:
No death, No death in yonder home.

4.
Clasping again our own,
Knowing as we are known,
Walking no more alone,
Hail sinless Eden years!
No tears, No tears in yonder home.
