# 1

O come, let us sing to the Lord,

Come let us every one

A joyful noise make to the Rock

Of our salvation.



# 2

Let us before His presence come

With glad and thankful voice;

Let us sing psalms of praise to Him,

And make a joyful noise.



# 3

For God, a great God and great King,

Above all gods, He is;

The depths of earth are in His hand,

The strength of hills is His.



# 4

To Him the ocean vast belongs,

For He the sea did make;

The dry land also from His hands,

Its form at first did take.



# 5

O come, bow down and worship Him,

And kneeling, humbly pray,

Come to our Maker and our God,

And hear His voice today.
