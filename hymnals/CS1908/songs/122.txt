1
The Lord first empties whom he fills,
Casts down whom he would raise;
He quickens when the letter kills,
Exalting thus his praise.
When he applies his healing blood
Unto a sin-sick soul,
This balsam, pow'rful, precious, good,
Ne'er fails to make it whole.

2
On us he spent his life and blood,
Our losses to retrieve;
Mankind's redemption now holds good
For sinners who believe.
Lord, I believe!  whate'er befall,
A thankful heart be mine,
A heart that answers to thy call,
One that is wholly thine.
