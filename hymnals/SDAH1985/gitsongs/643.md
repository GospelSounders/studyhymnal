# 1

Father, who on us do shower

Gifts of plenty form Your dower,

To Your people give the power

All Your gifts to use aright.



# 2

Give pure happiness in leisure

Temperance in every pleasure,

Wholesome use of earthly treasure

Bodies clean and spirits bright.



# 3

Lift from this and every nation

All that brings us degradation;

Quell the forces of temptation;

Put Your enemies to flight.



# 4

Father, You who sought and found us,

Son of God, whose love has bound us,

Holy Spirit, in us, round us,

Hear us, Godhead infinite.
