# 1

O sing a new song to the Lord

For marvels He has done;

His right hand and His holy arm

The victory have won.



# 2

With harp, and voice of psalms

Unto Jehovah sing;

Let trumpets and the echoing horn

Acclaim the Lord our King!



# 3

Let seas with all their creatures roar,

The world and dwellers there,

And let the rivers clap their hands,

The hills their joy declare.



# 4

Before the Lord: because He comes,

To judge the earth come He;

He’ll judge the world

with righteousness,

His folk with equity.
