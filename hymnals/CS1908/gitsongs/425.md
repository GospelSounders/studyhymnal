# 1

Coming Saviour, now in faith

We remember still thy death;

Thou wast broken thou hast died;

For us thou wast crucified.



# 2

While in faith we drink the wine,

Of thy blood we see the sign;

Wash us pure from ev'ry stain,

Thou that comest soon to reign.



# 3

Lord, we thus remember thee,

But we long thy face to see

Long to reach our heav'nly home;

Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
