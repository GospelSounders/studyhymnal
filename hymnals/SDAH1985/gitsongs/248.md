# 1

There is a Name I love to hear,

I love to sing its worth;

It sounds like music in my ears,

The sweetest Name on earth.



# Refrain

O how I love Jesus,

O how I love Jesus,

O how I love Jesus,

Because He first loved me.



# 2

It tells me of a Savior’s love,

Who died to set me free;

It tells me of a Savior’s blood,

The sinners’ perfect plea.



# 3

It tells of one whose loving heart

Can feel my deepest woe;

Who in each sorrow bears

A part that none can bear below.
