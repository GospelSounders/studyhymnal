# 1

Let our hearts be always cheerful;

Why should murm'ring enter there,

When our kind and loving Father

Makes us children of His care?



Refrain:

Always cheerful always cheerful,

Sunshine all around we see;

Full of beauty is the path of duty,

Cheerful we may always be.



# 2

With His gentle hand to lead us,

Should the pow'rs of sin assail,

He has promised grace to help us;

Never can His promise fail.  [Refrain]



# 3

When we turn aside from duty,

Comes the pain of doing wrong;

And a shadow, creeping o'er us,

Checks the rapture of our song.  [Refrain]



# 4

Oh!  the good are always happy,

And their path is ever bright;

Let us heed the blessed counsel,

Shun the wrong and love the right.  [Refrain]
