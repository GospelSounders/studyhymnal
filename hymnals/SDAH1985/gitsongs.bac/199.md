# 1

The head that once was crowned with thorns

Is crowned with glory now;

A royal diadem adorns

The mighty victor’s brow.



# 2

The highest place that heaven affords

Is His, is His by right;

The King of kings, and Lord of lords,

And heaven’s eternal light.



# 3

The joy of all who dwell above,

The joy of all below,

To whom He manifests His love,

And grants His name to know.



# 4

To them the cross, with all its shame,

With all its grace is given;

Their name an everlasting name,

Their joy the joy of heaven.



# 5

To them the cross, with all its shame,

With all its grace is given;

Their name an everlasting name,

Their joy the joy of heaven.
