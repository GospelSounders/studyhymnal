# 1

O Holy Saviour, Friend unseen,

Since on Thine arm Thou bidds't me lean,

Help me, thro'out life's varying scene,

By faith to cling to Thee.



# 2

Blest with this fellowship Divine,

Take what Thou wilt, I'll ne'er repine;

E'en as the branches to the vine,

My soul would cling to Thee.



# 3

What tho' the world deceitful prove,

And earthly friends and joys remove,

With patient, uncomplaining love

Still would I cling to Thee.



# 4

Blest is my lot, whate'er befall;

What can disturb me, who appall,

While as my strength, my Rock, my All,

Saviour, I cling to Thee?
