882 â€“ One Sweetly Solemn Thought


1.
One sweetly solemm tho't,
Comes to me o'er and o'er;
I'm nearer to my home today,
Than e'er I've been before.

Chorus:
Nearer my home,
Nearer my home;
Nearer my home today, today,
Than e'er I've been before.

2.
Nearer my Father's house,
Where many mansions be;
Nearer the throne where Jesus reigns,
Nearer the crystal sea.  [Chorus]

3.
Nearer my going home,
Laying my burdens down,
Leaving my cross of heavy grief,
Wearing my starry crown.  [Chorus]
