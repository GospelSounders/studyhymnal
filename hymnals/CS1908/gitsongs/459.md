# 1

Our blest Redeemer, ere He breathed

His tender last farewell,

A Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed

With us to dwell.



# 2

He came sweet influence to impart,

A gracious, willing guest,

While He can find one humble heart

Wherein to rest.



# 3

And His that gentle voice we hear,

Soft as the breath of ev'n, 

That checks the wrong, that calms the fear, 

And speaks of heav'n.



# 4

And ev'ry virtue we possess,

And ev'ry vict'ry won,

And ev'ry tho't of holiness

Are His alone.



# 5

Spirit of purity and grace,

Our weakness, pitying, see;

O make our hearts Thy dwelling place,

Till all like Thee.
