# 1

If you are tired of the load of your sin,

Let Jesus come into your heart;

If you desire a new life to begin,

Let Jesus come into your heart.



Chorus:

Just now, your doubtings give o'er;

Just now, reject Him no more;

Just now, throw open the door;

Let Jesus come into your heart.



# 2

If 'tis for purity now that you sigh,

Let Jesus come into your heart;

Fountains for cleansing are flowing near by,

Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]



# 3

If there's a tempest your voice cannot still,

Let Jesus come into your heart;

If there's a void this world never can fill,

Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]



# 4

If friends, once trusted, have proven untrue,

Let Jesus come into your heart;

Find what a Friend He will be unto you.

Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]



# 5

If you would join the glad songs of the blest,

Let Jesus come into your heart:

If you would enter the mansions of rest,

Let Jesus come into your heart.



Chorus:

Just now, my doubtings are o'er; 

Just now, rejecting no more;

Just now, I open the door,

And Jesus comes into my heart.
