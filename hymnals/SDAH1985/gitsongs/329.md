# 1

Take the world, but give me Jesus;

All its Joys are but a name,

But His love abideth ever,

Through eternal years the same.



# Refrain

Oh, the height and depth of mercy!

Oh, the length and breadth of love!

Oh, the fullness of redemption,

Pledge of endless life above.



# 2

Take the world, but give me Jesus,

Sweetest comfort of my soul;

With my Savior watching o’er me,

I can sing, though billows roll.



# 3

Take the world, but give me Jesus;

Let me view his constant smile;

Then throughout my pilgrim journey

Light will cheer me all the while.



# 4

Take the world, but give me Jesus;

In His cross my trust shall be,

Till, with clearer, brighter vision

Face to face my Lord I see.
