1.

O God, beneath thy guiding hand,

Our exiled fathers cross the sea;

And when they trod the wintry strand,

With pray'r and psalm they worshiped thee.



2.

Truth, freedom, justice, faith in God,

Came with those exiles o'er the waves;

And where their pilgrim feet have trod,

The God they trusted guards their graves.



3.

And here thy name, O God of love,

May we, their children, still adorn,

Till these eternal hills remove,

And spring adorns the earth no more.
