# 1

Jesus, I will follow thee,

For I hear thee calling me;

Loving, trusting, glad I come,

To let thee lead me home.



Chorus:

I will follow thee,

I will follow thee, 

I will follow thee

Wherever thou dost lead.



# 2

Little eyes might lose the way,

Little feet might go astray;

I might weak and weary be,

But thou art strong for me.  [Chorus]



# 3

Grief and want may be my foes,

Foolish sins my way oppose;

Full of courage I will be,

Whene'er I follow thee.  [Chorus]
