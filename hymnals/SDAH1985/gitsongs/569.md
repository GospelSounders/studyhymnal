# 1

Pass me not, O gentle Savior,

hear my humble cry;

while on others thou art calling,

do not pass me by.



# Refrain

Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;

while on others thou art calling,

do not pass me by.



# 2

Let me at thy throne of mercy

find a sweet relief,

kneeling there in deep contrition;

help my unbelief.



# 3

Trusting only in thy merit,

would I seek thy face;

heal my wounded, broken spirit,

save me by thy grace.



# 4

Thou the spring of all my comfort,

more than life to me,

whom have I on earth beside thee?

Whom in heaven but thee?
