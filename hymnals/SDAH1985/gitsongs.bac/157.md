# 1

Go to dark Gethsemane,

Ye who feel the tempter’s power

Your Redeemer’s conflict see.

Watch with him one bitter hour;

Turn not from his griefs away;

Learn from Jesus Christ to pray.



# 2

See Him at the judgment hall,

Beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;

See Him meekly bearing all;

Love to man His soul sustained!

Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;

Learn from him to bear the cross.



# 3

Calvary’s mournful mountain climb;

There, adoring at his feet,

Mark that miracle of time,

God’s own sacrifice complete.

“It is finished!” hear him cry;

Learn from Jesus Christ to die.
