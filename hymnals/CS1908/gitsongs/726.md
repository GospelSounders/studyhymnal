# 1

God moves in a mysterious way

His wonders to perform:

He plants His footsteps in the sea,

And rides upon the storm.



# 2

Deep in unfathomable mines

Of never-feeling skill,

He treasures up His bright designs,

And works His sovereign will.



# 3

Ye faithful saints, fresh courage take!

The clouds ye so much dread,

Are big with mercy, and will break

In blessings on your head.



# 4

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,

But trust Him for His grace;

Behind a frowning providence

He hides a smiling face.



# 5

Blind unbelief is sure to err,

And scan His work in vain;

God is His own interpreter,

And He will make it plain.
