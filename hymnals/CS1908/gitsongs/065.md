# 1

There's life in a look at the sacred cross,

Jesus has said, "Look unto me;"

Earth with its riches is only dross,

Bright treasures beyond in the cross I see.



Chorus:

In a look there's life for thee,

In a look at Calvary;

Blessed thought, Salvation free,

By a look at Calvary.



# 2

When first to the Saviour I raised my eyes,

Sweet was the smile that fell on me;

Oft as the clouds of temptation rise,

A look at the cross still my strength shall be.  [Chorus]



# 3

I'll look to the cross ev'ry day and hour,

Trusting the promise God has given;

None ever fall neath the tempter's pow'r,

Who trust and obey in the strength of Heav'n.  [Chorus]
