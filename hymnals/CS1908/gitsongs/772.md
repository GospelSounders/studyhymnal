772 â€“ Love's Golden Chain


1.
How sweet, how heav'nly is the sight,
When those who love the Lord
In one another's peace delight,
And thus fulfill his word!

2.
When, free from envy, scorn, and pride,
Our wishes all above,
Each can his brother's failings hide,
And show a brother's love!

3.
Love is the golden chain that binds
The trusting soul above;
And he's an heir of heav'n who finds
His bosom glow with love.
