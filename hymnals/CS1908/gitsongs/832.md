1.

Words are things of little cost,

Quickly spoken, quickly lost;

We forget them, but they stand

Witnesses at God's right hand,

And their testimony bear

For us or against us there.



2.

Oh, how often ours have been

Idle words and words of sin!

Words of anger, scorn, or pride,

Or deceit, our faults to hide,

Envious tales, or strife unkind,

Leaving bitter thoughts behind.



3.

Grant us, Lord, from day to day,

Strength to watch and grace to pray:

May our lips from sin kept free,

Love to speak and sing of Thee;

Till in heav'n we learn to raise

Hymns of everlasting praise.
