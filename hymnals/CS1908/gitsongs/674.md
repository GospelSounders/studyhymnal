# 1

When storms of life are sweeping,

When lonely watch I'm keeping,

When floods of ill are falling,

And tempter voices calling,



Chorus:  

Remember me, O Mighty One!

Remember me, O Mighty One!



# 2

When walking on life's ocean,

Control its raging motion;

When from its dangers shrinking,

When 'neath the billows sinking.  [Chorus]



# 3

When weight of care oppresses,

When thought of sin distresses;

Through all the life that's mortal,

And when I pass death's portal.  [Chorus]
